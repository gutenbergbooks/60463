<h2 id="CHAPTER_I" class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">COLONEL CARSON, OF CARSONVILLE.</span></h2>


<p>Chip Merriwell, in running togs, had just taken
a rail fence at a flying leap. As he dropped into
the road beyond the fence, he halted suddenly and
gave vent to a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant, a second figure in
athletic shirt and track pants came hurtling over
the fence, pulled up abruptly, and stood hanging
on to Merry’s shoulder. This second person was
Billy McQuade, with whom Frank Merriwell,
junior, was spending a few days of the spring
vacation.</p>

<p>The two friends had left home for a cross-country
hike together. It was now the middle
of the forenoon, they were on their way back,
and had still four miles to go before reaching
Carsonville.</p>

<p>The crisp spring air of morning gave the two
runners new life at every breath. To many a
languid youth it spelled laziness and lack of all
effort, but Merry and his friend knew from experience
that “spring fever” is only a convenient
name for doing nothing. Both of them were
looking forward to a luxurious relaxation in the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
long grass by the Carsonville mill pond that afternoon,
but they intended to make it all the more
enjoyable by an honest physical weariness.</p>

<p>At the point where the two friends struck the
highway, it curved in a wide horseshoe bend in
order to avoid a tongue of undrained swamp land
that struck up from the river. Merriwell had
come to the road on one side of the curve, intending
to follow the highway back to town.</p>

<p>As he took the hedge bordering the road with a
flying hurdle, he had caught sight of a buggy in
the white stretch directly ahead of him. That
one flashing glimpse had shown him a man in the
buggy, and, as he came to earth, he saw the horse
give a sudden leap, shying frantically at sight of
the flying figure.</p>

<p>Merriwell regretted instantly that he had not
looked before he had leaped, but it was now too
late. Before Billy McQuade took the leap in
turn, the mettlesome steed hitched to the buggy
was tearing around the bend of road, while the
lone occupant stood up sawing savagely at the
reins.</p>

<p>“That’s a lesson I should have learned before
this,” Merriwell murmured regretfully. “The
horse shied when I came over the hedge, and he’s
run away.”</p>

<p>“No doubt about that,” commented Billy,
watching with startled eyes. “He looks as if he
didn’t intend to stop this side of Fardale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>The course of the runaway was anything but
reassuring. The startled horse was racing madly
around the horseshoe bend, with the buggy leaping
and rocking behind him, threatening at every
instant to go over.</p>

<p>The driver still stood erect, however. He was
shouting in an angry tone of voice, and trying
vainly to curb the frightened animal. Disaster
was imminent at any moment.</p>

<p>“My eye!” Billy ejaculated soberly. “We’ve
done it this time, Chip!”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better undo it,” snapped Merriwell,
rousing himself. He pointed across the marshy
land to the opposite bend of the road.</p>

<p>“Come along, Billy! We can cut straight
across over there, and beat the horse to it. He’s
forced to go clear around the bend.”</p>

<p>“Practical lesson in geometry,” murmured
Billy, with a resigned look at the boggy strip.
“The shortest distance between two points is a
straight line. Go ahead, old man, I’m with you.
Hope the buggy will still be with the horse when
it gets there!”</p>

<p>Chip Merriwell leaped across the road, Billy
close behind him. They vaulted the rail fence on
that side, and set off across the marsh land at the
best possible speed.</p>

<p>It did not seem that Billy McQuade’s hope
would be fulfilled. The runaway had by this time
reached the central point of the curve, and the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
driver’s efforts seemed to have no effect, for the
buggy was careering and bouncing as if ready to
smash up at each wild leap.</p>

<p>Merriwell took a glance over his shoulder, and
increased his speed. But it was difficult to cover
the ground rapidly; pools of water lay here and
there, the soft grass and soaked soil sucked at
every step, and only by jumping from tussock to
tussock could progress be made.</p>

<p>The two runners made it, however. They
were nearly across the neck of sunken land when
Merriwell heard a startled cry from his friend,
and glanced around.</p>

<p>He was just in time to see the driver flung from
the buggy!</p>

<p>With a thrill of fear that his carelessness had
brought about an irreparable injury, Chip Merriwell
dashed forward. The horse was almost upon
him as he scrambled up and swung himself across
the fence, but the frightened beast had no time
to swerve. Taking a few long running steps,
Merry flung himself sideways and caught at the
bridle.</p>

<p>Almost directly, the horse stopped, trembling
and heaving. With a breath of relief, Merriwell
began stroking his muzzle, patting his neck, and
uttering soothing words. The animal perceived
that he was a friend, and stood quiet.</p>

<p>One swift glance showed that the buggy was
uninjured, then Merriwell looked around for the<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
driver, stepping back from the horse to get a
clear view.</p>

<p>He saw Billy McQuade meeting the driver,
who had risen to his feet. It was evident at once
that he had suffered from nothing worse than a
severe shock, for, as Merriwell turned and approached
the two, he heard the driver cursing
furiously. With a feeling of distaste, he inspected
the man, whose clothes Billy was hastily
brushing.</p>

<p>The driver of the rig was a tall, spare, stoop-shouldered
man. He was very well dressed, and
wore a gray mustache and goatee. There was a
hard set to his face, and a pouchiness beneath his
black eyes, that denoted self-indulgence, and a
life that was anything but what it should be.</p>

<p>“You good-for-nothin’ loafer!” he roared,
turning furiously on Billy, as Chip Merriwell
came up. “You done this a-purpose! You&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was not Billy’s fault at all,” broke in Merry
warmly. “I was the first one over the fence, and
your horse shied at me.”</p>

<p>The driver whirled on him, his rage becoming
a cold fury as he met Merriwell’s firm, steady
gaze.</p>

<p>“What are you doin’ in them duds?” he demanded.
“So it was you, hey?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and, although Merry’s eyes flashed at
the tone of the man, he kept his voice cool. “Yes,<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
and I’m very sorry about it. Of course, I’ll be
glad to settle for whatever damage was done.”</p>

<p>“Lot o’ good that’ll do!” growled the other,
who seemed to be eying him with anything but
liking. “What you chasin’ around in them duds
for?”</p>

<p>“We were doing a bit of cross-country running,”
Merriwell said quietly. Billy McQuade
was flashing him queer looks which he interpreted
as warnings, but he took no heed of them. “As
I said, I’ll expect to make good any damage, and
I’m very sorry the accident occurred. My name
is Frank Merriwell, junior, and you’ll find me at
the McQuades’ residence, if you want me.”</p>

<p>The man flung Billy a hard look, then laughed
sneeringly.</p>

<p>“Mebbe I will and mebbe I won’t,” he jeered.
“They ain’t goin’ to have a residence very long,
I reckon. I s’pose he put you up to scarin’ that
hoss, eh?”</p>

<p>“He did not!” cried Merry indignantly. The
insinuation made him angry clear through. Billy
flung him an imploring glance, but he was a chip
of the old block, and showed it in his next words.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who you are, my friend, but
you’ve got a disposition that I wouldn’t like to be
let loose with. We’ve caused an accident, or,
rather, I have, and I’ve apologized and offered to
do all in my power to make it right.</p>

<p>“Instead of throwing slurs and curses into the<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
atmosphere, it’d be a whole lot more decent if
you’d try to act white. I don’t blame you for
being mad. I’d probably be mad myself in the
same circumstances. But that’s no reason for
your acting in this way.”</p>

<p>The stranger gave him a black look, then moved
off.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he grunted sarcastically. “I guess
you’re like your dad, if all I’ve heard say is correct.
Let’s see what damage was done. I reckon
the buggy was smashed up.”</p>

<p>Merriwell and Billy McQuade followed him
to where the horse stood. The man went over the
buggy, then examined the horse.</p>

<p>“Ain’t nothing busted,” he said, almost regretfully,
it seemed. “But you kids are too gay, runnin’
around the country in them duds. It’s goin’
to be stopped.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let our clothes worry you,” retorted
Merry. “You know where to find me if you want
damages. Come along, Billy.”</p>

<p>He promptly turned his back. Billy threw a
dubious look at the man, then followed slowly.
Once more the deep voice reached Merriwell.</p>

<p>“You’ll be sorry for this, mind my words! You
ain’t a-going to talk to me that way and get off
with it, you young scoundrel!”</p>

<p>Chip Merriwell’s cheeks flamed a little, but he
kept a firm grip on himself and walked on. After
a moment he turned to see the man climb into his<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
buggy and give the horse a savage cut with the
whip.</p>

<p>“The brute!” he murmured indignantly.
“What that horse needs is a kind word, instead
of the lash. More than likely that fellow had
him whipped into such a temper that he would
have shied at a dead leaf.”</p>

<p>Billy nodded. To his surprise, Merry saw that
his friend’s usually clear, frank features were
overcast and troubled.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, old man? You seemed to
know that fellow.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>Billy cast a worried look at the rig, now disappearing
around the curve of the road.</p>

<p>“Here’s a go!” he muttered gloomily. “I guess
we’re all in for it now, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Why? That man isn’t the sheriff, is he?”
asked Merriwell, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No. He’s a whole lot worse. That chap
is Colonel Carson, who owns most of Carsonville,
and he’ll make the old burg plenty hot for
us now, believe me!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHY BILLY LEFT SCHOOL.</span></h2>


<p>Chip Merriwell looked curiously at his friend
and host.</p>

<p>“Has this Colonel Carson anything to do with
your leaving Fardale&mdash;or, rather, with your writing
that you would not be back?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Billy said, in a low voice. “Let’s walk
along, Chip, and I’ll tell you about it. It might
as well come out now as any time, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>It was Merry’s second day in Carsonville.
Billy McQuade, or, as he was more generally
known, “Billy Mac,” was a plebe at Fardale
Academy. During the preceding summer he had
shown remarkable ability as backstop on the
scrub nine, and it was reported that he was in line
to catch for the regular team during the coming
season. Billy Mac was also good at first, however,
so that Fardale had been in no little doubt.</p>

<p>Shortly before the spring vacation began, Billy
had been called home to Carsonville. His father
was dead, and his mother had merely written that
she needed Billy’s presence to settle up some portions
of the estate. Then had come a letter from
Billy himself&mdash;a heartbroken letter, stating that
he would be unable to return to Fardale.</p>

<p>He assigned no definite cause, and the reason
remained pretty much a mystery. It was a most<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
disconcerting mystery, also. Owen Clancy, Chip
Merriwell’s regular backstop, was somewhere off
in the Southwest. It had been pretty generally
settled that Billy Mac would don the mask this
season, and his sudden withdrawal was a body
blow to Fardale hopes.</p>

<p>These had been swiftly raised, however, when
on the last day of school before the vacation
Clancy had appeared without warning. He had
retrieved his family fortunes, and was ready to
pitch into work at Fardale once more. This, none
the less, did not throw any light upon the mystery
of Billy Mac’s dropping out.</p>

<p>Both Merry and his father had been no little
worried. Frank Merriwell, senior, had finally
suggested that Chip drop around to Carsonville
during vacation. Although head over ears in
track and field work, Chip had assented gladly.
Billy Mac sent him a cordial invitation to come
along, and he had promptly arrived.</p>

<p>The McQuade home was a comfortable, old-fashioned
residence on a hill near the river, just
outside of town. During his first day, Merry
had asked no questions, but his eyes had been
busy. He noted the worried, uneasy air of hospitable
Mrs. McQuade, and the nervousness of
his friend. It was not hard to guess that the
estate of the senior McQuade had fallen into difficulties,
though not a word had been said on the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s have it, old man,” said Merry gravely.
“Nothing helps a fellow so much as being able to
spout out his trouble to some one else.”</p>

<p>“I know,” sighed Billy Mac hopelessly. “But
this is different. I s’pose you remember about&mdash;about
dad dying just before Christmas holidays?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Chip sympathetically. “And we
were all mighty sorry to hear of it, old fellow.”</p>

<p>“Well,” went on the other, “things didn’t look
so bad just then. Mother had a thousand dollars
of insurance money, while the house and
orchard was ours. We’ve got some mighty fine
fruit trees there, and they promised to take care
of things pretty well.”</p>

<p>“I should think they would! Those apples you
dug up yesterday were something fine, Billy
Mac.”</p>

<p>“They were the last of the ones we buried last
fall, Chip. We shipped off some of them, for
with the apples and other things we get high
prices from the city. They seem to appreciate
getting extra fine fruit.”</p>

<p>“Of course they do. The trouble with most
farmers is that they don’t take pains enough to
market their crop right, and take care of it on
the way. But go ahead.”</p>

<p>Billy sighed again, and glanced heavily at the
river.</p>

<p>“This here Colonel Carson,” he broke out,<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
“suddenly produced a mortgage on the house and
orchard for two thousand dollars. That was just
before vacation, when mother wrote for me to
come home.”</p>

<p>“But you knew that he had the mortgage?”
queried Chip, frowning.</p>

<p>“We thought dad had paid it. You see, dad&mdash;well,
dad was kind of careless about money. Just
the same, we <em>knew</em> he had paid that mortgage.
Mother could find no receipt, however, and Carson
vowed that it had never been paid.”</p>

<p>“Somebody ought to teach him something,”
said Merry warmly. “Hadn’t you any proof
whatever?”</p>

<p>“Not a scratch, Chip. We couldn’t find a
single thing. Mother pleaded with him, and he
agreed to give us a little time in which to pay it&mdash;over
again. It hit us pretty hard, you see. We
knew that dad had paid it, but that villain Carson
only wants to get hold of the place.”</p>

<p>“Looks as though the scoundrel had you,” said
Merriwell thoughtfully. “Can you pay it, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Mother has that thousand insurance
money, and&mdash;well, to tell the truth, I’ve arranged
to get a job as clerk in the Carsonville general
store. If we can hold the colonel off a while, I
guess we can fix it.”</p>

<p>“Pretty hard lines, just the same,” commented
Merry. “So that’s why you wrote that you
wouldn’t be back to Fardale, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Billy Mac miserably. “It’s all off,
Chip. And now, after what’s happened this
morning&mdash;well, you can guess that Carson won’t
have much mercy.”</p>

<p>Merriwell whistled softly. Now he began to
see the possible disaster he had brought upon the
McQuade family through scaring Colonel Carson’s
horse. Recalling the man’s face, he was
forced to admit to himself that he could not see
much hope in it. Every line spelled hardness, cold
unscrupulousness.</p>

<p>There was good cause for Billy Mac’s worry&mdash;yet
he had cast no word of blame on Chip,
whose lack of caution seemed to have brought
wreck upon him. Merry appreciated this fact. It
was only another indication of the sterling qualities
of his friend.</p>

<p>At the same time, it gave him serious food for
thought. If Colonel Carson did come down upon
Mrs. McQuade, in his rage, Chip knew that he
would be morally responsible for it.</p>

<p>“I’m mighty sorry about this, old man,” he exclaimed
soberly, “What kind of a fellow is this
Carson? Is he well off?”</p>

<p>“Got slathers of money,” said Billy Mac, with
added gloom. “The burg was named after his
family, and he owns most of the main street, the
bank, and everything else, even the baseball
team.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“Baseball team?” inquired Merriwell sharply.
“A professional team?”</p>

<p>“No, the Clippers are made up of amateurs,
and stand pretty high in the Amateur League.
But it’s like everything else, Chip. The colonel
is said to be mighty careless about methods in
everything he does, so long as he gets what he
wants. The Carsonville Clippers are amateurs,
all right, but I notice most of ’em have jobs in
Colonel Carson’s bank, or on his farms, or somewhere.
And the jobs don’t need much attention.”</p>

<p>“So that’s it, eh?” Merriwell looked thoughtful.
“Are they a good bunch?”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the Clippers could
play ball, and play it well enough to win most of
their games. Carsonville, of course, was not a
large-enough place to support such a team, but,
where his one great hobby was concerned, Colonel
Carson was willing to spend money like water.</p>

<p>One reason for this was that his own son was
the star pitcher of the Clippers. Another was
that Colonel Carson had a consuming ambition
to make such a showing with his amateur team,
that he could buy into one of the larger professional-league
teams as a well-known follower
of the sport.</p>

<p>To this end, it was necessary that his team
should win games. The Clippers did so. But&mdash;and
this point Merry dragged by sheer force from
the reluctant Billy&mdash;it was whispered that Colonel<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
Carson did not care much how they won, so
long as they did win.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in repeating calumnies,” went
on Billy, “whether you like a man, or don’t. I believe
that Colonel Carson is a scoundrel and a liar
where my family is concerned, but I don’t like
to repeat things that have no foundation.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” exclaimed Chip. “But in a
case of this kind, rumor is apt to hit pretty close
to the mark, Billy Mac. Is there a good diamond
here?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” cried Billy enthusiastically. “Almost
as good as the Fardale grounds, Chip. It’s
laid out down below the milldam, by the river,
with concrete stands and all that. Colonel Carson
certainly does things up brown!”</p>

<p>“That’s what he wants,” agreed Chip. “It’ll
help his reputation with the league magnates. But
if he builds his reputation on secret chicanery and
dirty work, he isn’t going to get very far, and,
judging from your own case, it looks as though
Colonel Carson had a tricky streak right through
him.”</p>

<p>He could not help feeling sorry for Billy Mac,
even while admiring his sturdy pluck. To throw
up school, athletics, and everything else in order
to take up a hopeless undertaking was a stiff
proposition. And Billy’s task looked hopeless.</p>

<p>His salary as clerk in the Carsonville general
store would certainly be small. It would take him<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
a long time to get together a thousand dollars, to
add to the thousand his mother already possessed.
Yet it had been the only chance, and Billy Mac
had plunged desperately at it without a squeal for
help.</p>

<p>Merriwell knew better than to offer financial
assistance, though he knew that his father would
be glad to help the McQuades. He had seen
enough of Billy’s mother to guess at her pride,
and, as though Billy had read his secret thought,
he turned to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything to mother about my telling
you this,” he said quietly. “It may come out
other ways, or she may tell you herself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I understand,” interrupted Chip. “She
wouldn’t like to think that her guests had been
bothered with family troubles. She’s a mighty
fine mother to have, Billy.”</p>

<p>“You bet your boots!” and the other’s eyes
lighted up. “She didn’t want me to quit Fardale,
of course. But it was the only chance there was,
and she had to give in at last.”</p>

<p>“Well, the place isn’t lost yet, so brace up,” advised
Merriwell.</p>

<p>By the time they had finished this heart-to-heart
talk, they were at the outskirts of the town,
and nearing the McQuade home. Billy pointed
out a large white house set in from the road as
the Carson residence.</p>

<p>They had just passed this point, when, from a<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
bend in the road, came a shrill cry in a boyish
voice. An instant later they sighted two figures.
One was that of a rather small young fellow,
crouching; over him stood a tall, heavy-set figure,
striking at the smaller chap, and paying no
attention to his cries for mercy.</p>

<p>“My eye!” cried Billy Mac hotly. “Trail along,
Chip. I’ll give that brute something else to think
of!”</p>

<p>And Billy broke into a run, with a yell of anger.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.</span></h2>


<p>“Hel-l-lup!”</p>

<p>At sight of Chip Merriwell and Billy Mac, the
smaller of the two figures uttered a shrill appeal.
As the bully straightened up, the little fellow
writhed away and danced over to the side of the
road.</p>

<p>“Hello, Chub!” cried Billy, pausing. “What’s
the trouble? Were you playing?”</p>

<p>“Pl-l-laying nothing!” returned Chub shrilly,
dancing about in his rage, and pointing at his tormentor.
“That big stiff said I rooted too much
for the visiting team l-l-l-last Saturday! He
caught me and was l-l-lambasting me!”</p>

<p>Chip saw that his friend was fully competent
to handle the situation, and stood back. There
was something comical about the helpless rage of
Chub, and about his manner of stumbling speech,
that amused Merriwell.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine sort of sport, I don’t think!”
exclaimed Billy Mac, addressing the bully. “Just
because a fellow doesn’t root for you, you want
to punish him&mdash;and a little chap like Chub, too!”</p>

<p>The bully glowered at Billy Mac in a threatening
fashion. He was a hulking big fellow, wearing
a sporty necktie of flaming red, and a loud-checked<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
suit. His features were heavy and overbearing,
with deep-set black eyes, that gleamed
maliciously, and from one corner of his mouth
drooped a burned-out cigarette.</p>

<p>“What’s it to you, Billy Mac?” he growled
menacingly. “You’d better not try to show off
around here, just because you been to a military
academy fer a few months!”</p>

<p>“There’s no one showing off around here except
that necktie of yours,” snapped Billy Mac.
“It’s a wonder you couldn’t find a baby to lick,
you coward!”</p>

<p>It became evident to Merry that the two knew
each other, and that his friend cherished a thorough
dislike for the bully.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, Bil-l-ly!” chirruped Chub, who
was well out of danger by this time. It seemed
impossible for the little chap to pronounce the
letter “l” without spilling it out by degrees.
“L-l-l-lam him for me!”</p>

<p>The big fellow sneered.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think you can run the place,
Billy Mac, now that you’ve been away to school,
hey? You think you are a real athlete, with them
underwear things on, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Seeing that his friend was speechless with rage,
Merriwell interfered.</p>

<p>“It’s quite evident that you’re not fitted to pass
on athletes, my friend,” he broke in ironically.
“I’ve always found that the fellow who goes<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
around with a coffin nail sticking in his face is the
one who sticks in the bleachers. He doesn’t get
out and toss the ball very much.”</p>

<p>For some reason, this speech seemed to infuriate
the bully. He whirled on Merry with a
snarl of anger.</p>

<p>“Smart guy, ain’t you? I suppose you’re that
Merriwell kid that Billy’s been blowin’ about so
much?”</p>

<p>“It seems that you have some brain left, in
spite of cigarettes,” returned Merry dryly.
“You’re supposing a lot of things, my friend. It
might strike you to suppose that your absence is
better than your company.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” The big fellow clenched his
fists, glaring. “Say, fer about two cents I’d take
you down a peg, Slim-shanks!”</p>

<p>Billy Mac turned quickly.</p>

<p>“Look here, Chip, you butt out of this!” he demanded.
“Chub Newton’s a friend of mine, and
this isn’t your quarrel.”</p>

<p>“All right, old man,” said Merriwell, waving
his hand. “I’ll gladly turn over our genial friend
to you. He looks as if a dose of McQuade compound
would improve his health a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” shrieked Chub Newton, in wild delight.
“That’s the way to talk! L-l-listen to
that, Bul-l-ly! You’re goin’ to hear things, al-l-l
right!”</p>

<p>Bully favored Chub with a black look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve give you one lesson about closin’ that
jaw of yours, Chub,” he grated. “You’d better
lay mighty low, mind my words!”</p>

<p>There was something in the tone and aspect of
the fellow that struck a responsive chord in Merriwell’s
memory. What the familiarity was, he
could not fathom. However, he was sure that
there was a familiarity.</p>

<p>“L-l-light into him, Bil-l-ly!” pleaded Chub,
his shrill voice appearing to irritate Bully like
the buzzing of a mosquito. The latter shook his
fist threateningly.</p>

<p>“You heard what I said!” he roared. “Shut
that jaw, or I’ll show you what a real lambastin’
is, you tow-headed little rat!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will, Bully,” said McQuade.
Merriwell had thrown him a warning look, and
he had curbed his temper.</p>

<p>“Hey? Why not?” The big fellow turned on
Billy, seeming to comprehend for the first time
that he was being actually interfered with. “I
suppose you’ll stop me, hey?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been thinking it over quite a while,”
admitted Billy, with a grin. “Try a fresh cigarette,
Bully. It might help you to get ideas
faster.”</p>

<p>Chub Newton waved his arms in delight. A
few passers-by were pausing to listen to the altercation,
and the little fellow turned to them
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Watch Bul-l-ly catch it!” he sang out shrilly.
“He’s going to get a fal-l-len on harder than the
Sprucetown batters fel-l-l on him l-l-l-last Saturday!”</p>

<p>At this the big fellow’s face went positively
black with rage. It was clear that he could think
of no taunts to fling back at his diminutive foe,
so he did the next best thing that occurred to
him. He took a swift step toward Chub, his fists
clenched.</p>

<p>“No you don’t!”</p>

<p>Billy Mac leaped forward and caught his
shoulder, twirling him around.</p>

<p>“Look out!” roared Bully furiously. “I’ll
mash that smart-alec mouth o’ yours, you fool!
Go home an’ dress yourself!”</p>

<p>“I’d make a better job of it than you’ve done,”
retorted Billy, with contempt.</p>

<p>Among the gathering array a quick smile
passed, with significant looks at the loud attire
of the big fellow. This only served to infuriate
him the more. It was clear to Chip that Bully
was by no means a favorite, though for some reason
no voice was lifted against him, save that of
Chub Newton.</p>

<p>“Go for him, ol-l-ld scout!” Chub shrieked.
“You can l-l-lick him easy! He’s got a yel-l-ler
streak!”</p>

<p>“And you’ve got a yelling streak,” observed
Merry, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>Glaring from his deep-set eyes, Bully stepped
toward McQuade.</p>

<p>“I guess you need a lesson,” he growled.
“You’re gettin’ too all-fired smart around this
town, for a pauper.”</p>

<p>Billy went white.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner be a pauper than the son of a
crook,” he snapped. “And I’d sooner be the son
of a crook, than a crook myself, Bully!”</p>

<p>A murmur of applause went up from the
crowd. It was cut short by a roar from the big
fellow.</p>

<p>“Call me a crook, will you!”</p>

<p>With a quick lunge forward, he aimed a vicious
blow at Billy Mac. The backstop did not
appreciate the compliment, however.</p>

<p>Catching the blow on his arm, he took a quick
step in, and there was a dull smack. Bully went
staggering back.</p>

<p>“Yah!” chirruped Chub, in great glee. “I
tol-l-ld you! L-l-lam him again!”</p>

<p>The big fellow hesitated, with a surprised expression
on his face. Evidently concluding that
an accident had happened, he rushed at Billy with
a shout.</p>

<p>“Here’s where you get yours, smart alec!”</p>

<p>Billy Mac did not seem at all disturbed over
the prospect. He waited the rush quietly, and, as
the big fellow drove in another blow, Billy caught<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
the arm. He turned, jerked the other’s wrist
over his shoulder, and Bully flew over him into
the dust. This brought a shout of applause from
the spectators.</p>

<p>It was a simple jujutsu trick. Billy Mac had
not learned it very adroitly, but he had learned
it well enough to spill his adversary head over
heels. Bully was unhurt, and was up instantly,
brushing at his gay attire.</p>

<p>“Got some luck, ain’t you!” he sneered furiously.</p>

<p>“Better not try my luck again,” said Billy Mac,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Chub Newton let out a shrill yell.</p>

<p>“L-l-look at the l-l-loud guy now! Yah! Why
don’t you cl-l-laim you stubbed your toe, Bul-l-ly
Carson?”</p>

<p>Merriwell started. Could it be possible that
this fellow was the son of Colonel Carson, of
whom Billy Mac had spoken&mdash;the baseball
player? Yes, he placed the chap now. The
features and voice were not unlike those of Colonel
Carson.</p>

<p>However, he had no time to conjecture further.
Bully went at Billy Mac with a second rush, this
time exercising more caution. McQuade had to
depend entirely on his quickness, and proved that
it was quite dependable.</p>

<p>He slipped aside, raising a cloud of dust as he<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
did so, and tried to trip his opponent. Bully staggered
and lost his balance, and, as his arm flew
out wide, Billy Mac stepped in and his fist went
out.</p>

<p>Again there came a sharp crack as the blow
landed. The big fellow, struck fairly on the
angle of the jaw below the ear, shivered, and then
went reeling across the street. He pulled up at
the fence, clinging to it desperately.</p>

<p>“Yah! He’s scared out!” cried Chub.</p>

<p>So, indeed, it seemed. The blow had not been
hard enough to knock him out, yet he made no
offer to return to the fight. Instead, he raised his
fist and shook it menacingly.</p>

<p>“You’ll suffer for this!” he exclaimed. “You
wait till I see dad!”</p>

<p>“Yah!” shrilled Chub Newton, dancing wildly.
“Go put a muffl-l-ler on your new cl-l-lothes, Bully
Carson!”</p>

<p>Bully moved off, evidently sick of the encounter.
Since it was plainly over, the spectators
drifted away, and Chub Newton thanked his
rescuer. Billy Mac introduced him to Frank
Merriwell, junior, but seemed to have little delight
in his victory.</p>

<p>“Now I am in for it, and no mistake!” he exclaimed,
looking after the big fellow.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you notice the resemblance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“Well, yes. And I heard Chub call him Bully
Carson&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s his usual nickname. He is Colonel
Carson’s son, Chip. And I guess you can see that
I’ve done a pretty bad morning’s work for the
McQuade family.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">COLONEL CARSON’S REVENGE.</span></h2>


<p>“I’m awful-l-ly gl-l-lad to meet you! Bil-l-ly’s
tol-l-ld me a l-l-lot about Chip Merriwel-l-l!”</p>

<p>“We seem to have come along just right,” said
Merry, shaking hands with Chub. “But we’d
better get home, Billy Mac. We seem to attract
a good deal of attention in these running togs.”</p>

<p>Billy Mac nodded.</p>

<p>“Sure. You’d better come with me, Chub.
We’ll go down to the swimming hole near the
house and have a plunge.”</p>

<p>Chub looked disappointed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, fel-l-lows, but I can’t. I’m workin’
at the grocery, you know, and I got to get orders
this morning. I’l-l-l see you l-l-later, though.”</p>

<p>“You come down to the swimming hole,” offered
Billy quickly, “and I’ll help you make up
for lost time by covering this street and taking
orders.”</p>

<p>“Wil-l-l you, honest!” cried Chub! “Oh, hurray!
Watch me go!”</p>

<p>“Well, chase along to the river, then. We’ll
get our duds and be right down.”</p>

<p>Chub went capering off at full speed, while
Chip and Billy trotted off to the McQuade home.</p>

<p>Here they secured their clothes and towels,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
saying nothing to Mrs. McQuade of what had
happened that morning. Billy was full of fears,
but he forced them down in her presence. He
did not want to worry his mother unnecessarily.</p>

<p>When they left the house to get to the river,
they passed a corner of the orchard. It was
bright with blossoms, whose scent came sweetly
on the breeze, and Billy jerked his head toward
the gnarled trees.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to see those trees piling up an income
for Colonel Carson, Merry.”</p>

<p>Chip Merriwell nodded in comprehension.</p>

<p>“It would be hard, old chap. But that’s exactly
what they’re doing, right now, since you’ll
have to pay the loan a second time. Even that
will be better than letting the place fall into his
hands.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it,” and Billy shook his head
gloomily. “The mortgage is overdue, and he
could foreclose any time he wanted to, you see.
He’s going to be sore as blazes over what happened
this morning, too.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to be very fair-minded, for a
fact,” agreed Merry. “But it’s a bad plan to
worry over what hasn’t happened, Billy. Just
forget about financial troubles, and enjoy your
swim.”</p>

<p>It would have been hard for the most hardened
pessimist <em>not</em> to have enjoyed that plunge into the
cool, quiet old river, whose waters were backed<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
up for half a mile by the dam below, forming an
ideal swimming pond. The warm air was fresh
with the breath of fruit blossoms, for Carsonville
was in the fruit belt, and surrounded by
orchards.</p>

<p>After twenty minutes of vigorous exercise, the
three friends pulled themselves out on the grassy
bank and enjoyed a sun bath.</p>

<p>Somewhat to his surprise, Chip Merriwell
found that Chub Newton was older than he appeared,
and was an expert swimmer. Also, he
had no high opinion of the autocrats of his native
town.</p>

<p>“I hope the Cl-l-lippers get l-l-lambasted good
and proper this year,” he announced pleasantly.
“Bul-ly Carson has the worst case o’ swel-l-led
bean you ever saw!”</p>

<p>“He looks like it,” said Chip, stretching out
lazily. “Can he pitch?”</p>

<p>Chub Newton snorted disgustedly, but Billy
spoke up.</p>

<p>“Sure he can pitch, Chip. Chub has a private
grouch on, that’s all. Bully isn’t any great
favorite off the diamond, but he has the knack
of tossing the ball, all right.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” sniffed Chub. “He’s got l-l-luck with
him.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he said about Billy,” said Merriwell.
“What’s your private grievance against the
colonel’s son?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I wanted to pl-l-lay on the Cl-l-lippers,”
bubbled the little chap. Every time he struck the
letter “l” his tongue seemed unwilling to let go
of it. “I tried out with ’em and made good.
Then a bunch o’ city fel-l-lers come out here and
got jobs whil-le they pl-l-layed bal-l-l. They done
me, al-l-l right, and three or four other fel-l-lers,
too. I was too short to pl-l-lay third, and
one o’ them guys was a swel-l-l shortstop. That
l-let me out. L-l-lot o’ folks think that Colonel
Carson ought to ’a’ favored home pl-l-layers.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Merry
thoughtfully. “Of course, sentiment can’t enter
into ball games that way, Chub. If the odds
were about even, though, he might have done
so, I should think. Those city chaps aren’t ringers,
are they?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” spoke up Billy. “I don’t
think that even Colonel Carson would try that
game, Chip. He made quite a bit of bad feeling
among the young fellows here, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Time we were gettin’ dressed,” observed
Chub uneasily. “I hate to go, but those orders
have to be in before noon.”</p>

<p>The three took a last plunge into the cool
water, had a quick rub down, and dressed. Then
Chub and Billy Mac departed to take a short cut
back to town along the river banks, while Merry
returned to the house in order to write a letter<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
to his father. On the way, however, he reconsidered.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll let it wait till to-night,” he reflected.
“I’ll have a talk with Mrs. McQuade
first, if I can work it, and see how the idea strikes
her.”</p>

<p>As he passed the corner of the orchard, and
came to the garden patch that stretched below the
house, he paused suddenly. A sound of vehement
talking drifted down to him, and he recognized
the deep voice, with a thrill of alarm.</p>

<p>The next moment he made out a horse and
buggy standing in front of the house, in the
drive. An exclamation of dismay burst from
him, for he recognized it at once as the same
which he had encountered at the horseshoe bend
that morning.</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible!” he murmured. “Colonel
Carson wouldn’t try such a trick!”</p>

<p>He approached the house, and, as he did so,
his alarm increased. There was no doubt that
the autocrat of Carsonville was present, and that
he was extremely angry. As Merriwell sprang
to the wide veranda, he clearly heard the vibrant
tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, that graceless son of yours publicly assaulted
my boy in the streets, not half an hour
ago, Mrs. McQuade. It’s the last straw, I tell
you! First he tries to frighten my horse, then
he assaults my son. If it hadn’t been for the<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
spectators, he might have killed the poor fellow.
Now, you’ve either got to pay that mortgage or
move out.”</p>

<p>Merry chuckled at this version of the incident.
Then his face became serious.</p>

<p>“Billy is a good son,” faltered the voice of
Mrs. McQuade. “I’m sure there’s some mistake,
Colonel Carson. He’s going to start to work
Monday at the store, and we hope to pay you that
loan before long.”</p>

<p>“You’ll pay up inside of five days,” stormed
the angry man. “I’m sick of this fool way of conductin’
business, mind my words! You’ve got
till Monday mornin’, then out you go, if you don’t
settle.”</p>

<p>Merriwell stepped to the door, his eyes snapping.
Colonel Carson stood inside, and Mrs.
McQuade was helplessly facing him.</p>

<p>“I think you’ve made a mistake, sir,” said
Chip quietly. Carson swung around. “I was
present at the encounter in the street, and I assure
you that your son was in no danger. Billy
hit him twice, and he lost his nerve and started
for home.”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson’s face purpled with fury.</p>

<p>“So you admit it, hey?” he roared. “You can
be mighty thankful, young man, if I don’t have
both o’ you arrested for this business! Nice
goings on, this is!”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t do any arresting in a<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
hurry,” said Chip calmly. “It wouldn’t make a
very nice story to get out about your son. The
‘poor fellow,’ as you call him, was brutally beating
little Chub Newton, and Billy stepped in to
prevent it, that’s all. If there’s any arresting to
be done, it might be the other way around, for
your son assaulted Billy first.”</p>

<p>Mrs. McQuade gave Merriwell a grateful
glance. Colonel Carson sputtered.</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!” he broke out.</p>

<p>Chip’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“I think we’ve had enough of your brand of
politeness,” he said quickly. “You have given
Mrs. McQuade until next Monday to pay you,
and that settles your business in this house, Colonel
Carson.”</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?” shouted the enraged
autocrat. “You ain’t got any right here neither&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think you had better go, Colonel Carson,”
and Mrs. McQuade gestured toward the door,
with quiet dignity. “I have no legal proof of
the mortgage having been paid, although the fact
is morally certain. If we are not able to pay you
before Monday, we cannot resist eviction, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Fine chance you have of raising two thousand
dollars by then!” sneered Colonel Carson,
grasping his hat. “I’ll be around at eight o’clock
Monday morning, so you’d better be packed up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>And with that he left, still muttering threats.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about this, Mrs. McQuade,” said
Merriwell. “But don’t give up hope yet. Billy
told me about the matter after we met Colonel
Carson this morning.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to keep up heart,” and the good
woman looked out the door, her face strained and
hopeless. “You see, we are positive that Mr.
McQuade paid off that loan long ago, but we have
no proof that would stand in law. It seems hard
that such a man as Colonel Carson should drive
us out!”</p>

<p>“He’s not done it yet,” responded Chip cheerfully.
“I never knew chicanery to get a man anything
lasting, Mrs. McQuade. It may seem to
win out, but there are other things more important
than money, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good comfort, Mr. Merriwell,” and
she gave him a smile, as she dabbed at her eyes
with her apron. “Well, I’ll have to see about
those cookies&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And she went to the kitchen, leaving Chip
in a thoughtful mood. When Billy returned half
an hour later, he was wrathful at hearing of the
colonel’s ultimatum, but could see no hope ahead.
During luncheon, however, Merry made a
proposition.</p>

<p>“If I could get a thousand dollars to add to
your thousand, Mrs. McQuade, would you let me
lend it to you? You could pay me interest, of<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
course, and give me a mortgage to that amount,
if you liked, as security.”</p>

<p>This proposal was argued pro and con., but
Chip had made it in such a way that it was a
straight business proposition, and in the end Mrs.
McQuade assented, providing that Merriwell
could get the money.</p>

<p>So that night Chip wrote his father at Bloomfield.
He related the situation at Carsonville,
told what had happened that day, and stated that
since he felt responsible in some measure, he
would like to borrow a thousand dollars from his
father in order to help out the McQuades. It
never occurred to him that his father might refuse
the loan.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE VILLAGE GREEN.</span></h2>


<p>“When are them guys coming?”</p>

<p>“They’ll be along pretty quick, Bully. I hear
there ain’t any game Saturday?”</p>

<p>“No. There’s been a flood down the valley,
and them Greenville scrubs wired that they
wouldn’t be up. They’re all helpin’ flood sufferers.
Think o’ lettin’ a little thing like that interfere
with our schedule!”</p>

<p>Bully Carson grunted sarcastically. It was
evident that he had little use for flood sufferers.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bully, let’s get a little practice right
here,” suggested one of the half dozen fellows
standing around in baseball uniforms. “Bunting
practice.”</p>

<p>“Might’s well, while we’re waiting, I suppose,”
assented Carson.</p>

<p>They were waiting by the schoolhouse, lolling
about the village green, and waiting for the remainder
of the Clippers to show up for the morning
work-out. Off at one side stood a group of
young fellows who were watching proceedings
with scowling faces.</p>

<p>Bully Carson and “Squint” Fletcher, who covered
home plate for the Clippers, stepped out and
began to plunk a ball back and forth. Hendrix,
the shortstop, seized a bat and began to bunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>At this juncture; Frank Merriwell, junior, accompanied
by Billy Mac, strolled up. They had
been having a work-out of their own down by
the river, and Billy carried his catcher’s mitt.
They paused not far from the group of discontented-looking
chaps, who nodded to Billy. Merriwell
was introduced, and all watched the Clippers
at work.</p>

<p>It was the morning after Colonel Carson’s
ultimatum had been delivered. From the comments
which were passed, Chip decided that the
young fellows of Carsonville cherished a distinct
feeling of dislike for the colonel’s son, who was
captain of the Clippers.</p>

<p>“Bully gives me a pain,” declared one of the
group, Bud Bradley. He proceeded to narrate
Carson’s comment on the action of the Greenville
club.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound extra well,” commented
Merry. “It’d be more to the point if the Clippers
would pile down to Greenville and help out
the flood sufferers.”</p>

<p>“No chance of that,” exclaimed Dan McCarthy,
a lanky village youth. “Nobody ever
heard o’ Bully Carson helpin’ any one, nor his dad
neither.”</p>

<p>“Howdy, fel-l-lers,” piped Chub Newton, as he
joined the group. “Any one want to order groceries
this morning? I hear there’s no game
Saturday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>“Open date,” returned Billy. “Too late now
to rearrange things, too.”</p>

<p>“Look at that second baseman drop them!”
growled Jim Spaulding.</p>

<p>“And talkin’ about bushers, watch that feller
who tries to play first,” added McCarthy.</p>

<p>“Yah!” jeered Chub Newton, prodding Bud
Bradley in the ribs and dancing away. “You
fel-l-lers are jeal-l-lous, that’s what! You’re sore
because you aren’t inside of those uniforms.”</p>

<p>“And who wouldn’t be sore?” said Bradley
hotly. “When that fellow Carson blacklists his
own townfolks, and drags in city players, it’s
enough to make any one hot!”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t as if we wasn’t good ball players,
either,” added McCarthy. “Bully knows he
couldn’t show off around us, that’s all. He wants
to be captain, and he’d stand a fine chance of us
electin’ him!”</p>

<p>Merriwell moved off a few steps, watching the
Clippers. The foregoing remarks had indicated
clearly the position of things in the town. The
group of disgruntled natives comprised several
of those who, like Billy Mac, had been ousted
from the Clippers by the imported amateurs.</p>

<p>It was not hard to understand the reason for
this, and Merry found himself in sympathy with
the feeling. Knowing what he did of Bully Carson,
he thought it highly probable that the captain
of the Clippers doubted his ability to hold<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
that position among the young fellows who had
grown up with him.</p>

<p>It was much easier to impress a crowd of chaps
who worked for his father. They would be very
likely to toady to him, and allow him to lead them.
This was plainly the sort of thing that Carson
loved.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” remarked Chip to Billy, who
stood beside him, “I don’t think your friends give
him full credit, old man. He looks like a good
pitcher, and those other chaps know their business.”</p>

<p>“You’d show him up in two jerks, Chip,” declared
Billy stoutly. Merry smiled, but did not
reply.</p>

<p>Carson had noted the arrival of the two
friends, for more than once he looked blackly at
the group, and passed remarks to his companions
that drew their eyes also. They grinned at his
words as if they formed great strokes of humor.</p>

<p>Merry saw at once, however, that Carson knew
his business. So did the rest of the Clippers.
They had spread out over the green, and handled
the bunts in fine shape, moving in perfect harmony
and whipping over the ball with precision.</p>

<p>Their captain and star pitcher might have a
bad case of “swelled head,” but he showed that
when it came to pitching, he was right there. As
a group of girls passed on the other side of the
street, he proceeded to cut loose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>And Merry admitted to himself that Bully Carson
was a pitcher. He had speed and good control,
while his curves broke sharply.</p>

<p>“Aw, cut out the comedy, cap,” growled his
catcher, Squint Fletcher. “This ain’t no stage
performance!”</p>

<p>Carson scowled, but kept silent. Perhaps he
had already discovered that his husky backstop
had little desire to truckle to him.</p>

<p>“Say, I got an idea!” chirruped Chub Newton
shrilly. His voice lifted across to the green, and
it caused Bully Carson to throw a vicious glance
in the direction of the group.</p>

<p>“Be careful of it,” grinned McCarthy. “You
want to set on it an’ hold it gently by the ears,
Chub. Don’t push it too hard.”</p>

<p>“You l-l-listen to me,” went on the little fellow
eagerly. “We could get a better team right
here in town than those Cl-l-lippers! I’d l-l-like
to form another one, a cl-l-lub of our own, and
l-l-lambaste the spots out o’ them!”</p>

<p>At this astounding proposal, the members of
the group stared at each other. Carson, who
must have heard the words, looked blacker than
ever, but continued tossing the ball.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t do it,” and Bud Bradley shook
his head. “We’ve no money for grounds or uniforms
or things, and most of us have to keep
close to work.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to show that second baseman up, just<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
the same,” said Spaulding. “But I guess there’s
no chance, Chub.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” spoke up Billy Mac hastily.
“We’ve got uniforms of one kind and another already,
haven’t we? We don’t need grounds&mdash;we
can practice up and beat the Carsonville Clippers
on their own grounds, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Yah! That’s the stuff!” shrieked Chub,
dancing excitedly. “Wouldn’t that be a scream,
though! A bunch of us l-l-lambastin’ the town
cl-l-lub! Wow!”</p>

<p>It was plain that Chub’s proposition appealed
strongly to most of those present, but the difficulties
seemed insurmountable.</p>

<p>“It’d take down Colonel Carson a heap,” muttered
McCarthy. “I’d do a good deal to pay him
back fer the way he gobbled our pasture lots,
when his cussed mortgage come due!”</p>

<p>“Look here,” exclaimed Billy Mac, with eagerness.
“It isn’t near so bad as it looks, honest!
We got pretty near a full infield right here in this
crowd. We could get to work and practice off
days till the ball season gets going, then light into
that bunch right.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good,” admitted Spaulding. “But it
won’t work, Billy. Those fellows are sluggers
from Sluggville. We’d have to have a crackajack
pitcher to hold ’em down. And you know
as well as I do that we’d have a hard job hitting
Carson.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” retorted Billy Mac. “Mebbe
we could get Chip Merriwell, here, to come down
from Fardale and pitch!”</p>

<p>At this proposal, every eye went to Merry. McQuade’s
eager seconding sent Chub into spasms
of delight.</p>

<p>“Yah!” he piped shrilly. “Put Chip in the
box, and watch him l-l-lam Carson! See him
cl-l-lip the Cl-l-lippers! Yah!”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the plan, Merriwell?”
inquired Bud Bradley doubtfully. “Would you
be willing to come over and pitch?”</p>

<p>Merry nodded. Before he could speak, however,
his eye was caught by a sudden movement
on the part of Carson’s team.</p>

<p>Three or four members had just arrived. Bully
Carson, who must have heard the eager cries of
Chub Newton, had immediately ceased practice.
He had gathered the Clippers around him, and
appeared to be talking vigorously, though his
words were lost.</p>

<p>“You’d better put on the soft pedal, Chub,”
advised Merry. “Seems to me that Bully has it
in for you and Billy Mac.”</p>

<p>“Let him come!” sniffed Billy. “But what do
you think about the idea, Chip?”</p>

<p>The group closed in about Merriwell, every
member anxious for his opinion, as Billy had
more than once described the diamond wizard’s
prowess to his home friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>Merry hesitated, as he glanced around the
faces. It did not appear likely that the Clippers
could be easily trounced, and, besides this, he
did not like to appear to be stirring up ill feeling.</p>

<p>He knew that there was a strong current of
dislike against the Carson methods. At the same
time, Colonel Carson controlled the town, and
could possibly make it hot for those who opposed
his son. Merry hesitated to give advice, under
the circumstances, but finally nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think the idea’s a good one, if you don’t
carry your antagonism to extremes. As to coming
over and pitching for you, I can’t promise
definitely. I’d be glad to do it, of course, if things
shape themselves right.”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” went up a general shout of delight,
and Billy Mac patted his friend on the back, until
Merry almost choked.</p>

<p>“Hurray for you, Chip! I knew you wouldn’t
go back on us!” he cried.</p>

<p>“By gum, we’ll have the first practice this
afternoon!” exclaimed McCarthy, in high excitement.
“Chub can get off o’ the store, I reckon,
and we’ll go down to the river an’ start things!
Jim, can we get enough fellers together?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” assented Spaulding, with a nod.
“Merriwell might be able to give us some good
advice, and he could get a line on our work.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sudden cry from Chub
Newton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Hey! L-l-look out, fel-l-lers! Here they
come!”</p>

<p>Merry and the others turned quickly. Bearing
down upon them was Bully Carson, a bat in
his hand, and crowding around him were the
members of the Clippers. One and all looked
ugly in the extreme.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A CHALLENGE.</span></h2>


<p>As the Clippers approached, there was no sign
of giving way in the ground around Merriwell.
The Carsonville boys were not equal in numbers,
but they were plainly anxious enough for
battle. Carson paused a few yards distant.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” snapped Merry.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ to run you out o’ town, see?”
retorted Squint Fletcher, his cross eyes glaring
savagely. “You’re here tryin’ to stir up trouble
against us, eh? Well, you don’t get no chance.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re misinformed,” returned Chip
quietly. “No one’s stirring up a fuss except
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” Bully Carson pushed forward
aggressively, clutching his bat. “I suppose
you didn’t try to kill dad yesterday, hey? I suppose
you didn’t set Billy Mac on me, hey?”</p>

<p>“You’re doing a lot of supposing,” said Merry
dryly. “Your thinking apparatus needs oiling,
Bully. Try a cigarette. It may straighten out
things.”</p>

<p>Merriwell’s calm demeanor, and the resolute
air of the group around him, rather cooled the
ardor of the Clippers. It only angered Carson
and Fletcher the more, however.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>“So you’re the famous Chip Merriwell, hey?”
spluttered Squint, shoving his undershot chin forward.
“I guess we’ve heard enough slush out o’
you and the rest o’ this gang. Let’s beat ’em up
proper, fellers!”</p>

<p>“Yah!” chirruped Chub, dancing on the outskirts
of the crowd. “Try it! Ask Bul-l-ly
where he got that bump on his chin. Ask him!”</p>

<p>This sally scored, for Billy Mac’s fist had left
unmistakable marks on the heavy countenance of
the captain of the Clippers.</p>

<p>“You’ll get yours, you little runt!” foamed the
angry Carson, brandishing his bat at Chub.
“We’ll make you pretty sick of lettin’ off your
jaw around here!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a mighty slow bunch to git
started,” observed the lanky, bronzed McCarthy,
who worked in the orchards, and looked it. He
spat on his hands. “I allus did want to paste
them lamps of yours, Squint.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get your wish, all right,” added Bud
Bradley, shoving forward belligerently. “Let’s
take Carson down and throw him in the river,
fellows!”</p>

<p>This proposal was greeted with high delight
on the part of the town group. The Clippers began
to move forward, and Merriwell saw that a
conflict was imminent.</p>

<p>“You’d better go slow,” he advised the Carson
crowd. “We’re not forcing any battle, remember.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
Keep back there, Bradley. If they start it,
let them take the consequences.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got ’em scared already,” jeered Squint
Fletcher. “Leave that Merriwell kid to me. I’ll
handle him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you won’t!” piped up Chub Newton.
“Yah! L-l-lambaste ’em, Bil-l-ly!”</p>

<p>Chub’s shrill cry was the last straw. Carson
emitted a furious roar and raised his bat, while
his team began crowding forward. The group
around Merry closed in compactly, and it looked
as if there would surely be a fight.</p>

<p>At that instant, however, a brawny man shoved
in between the two parties. Squint Fletcher was
just aiming a blow, and the man seized him by
the shoulders and flung him back, sending him
into Carson with a thump.</p>

<p>“That’s enough o’ this!” roared the town constable,
for the man was no other. “I been keepin’
my eye on you, Fletcher. Clear out o’ here, the
bunch of you.”</p>

<p>“What right have you got to interfere?” cried
Carson angrily. “I’ll have my father&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You shut up, or I’ll pinch you!” exclaimed
the constable hotly. “I don’t care for either you
or your dad. I’m constable o’ this town. Git out,
now, and do it lively, or I’ll run the lot o’ you
in! Jump!”</p>

<p>He pulled forth his club. Seeing that he
meant business, Carson flung a sullen look<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
around, nodded to his gang, and they melted
away. The constable turned to Merry.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Chip, smiling. “We
were afraid they meant trouble.”</p>

<p>“So they did,” growled the constable. “You’d
better let ’em simmer down.”</p>

<p>“We will,” said Billy. The group was just
breaking up when Merriwell halted them.</p>

<p>“One minute, everybody. What do you say to
getting a game with the Clippers this Saturday?
I believe it’s an open date; I can pitch, and if
you’re willing to work between now and then, we
can give them a run for their money!”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” A yell of delight burst from every
throat.</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” cried Spaulding, grabbing
Merry’s hand and pumping it.</p>

<p>“No, us fer Bully!” said McCarthy. “You bet
we will!”</p>

<p>“Can you get a team together?” asked Chip.
“If you can, meet at Billy’s house to-night and
talk things over.”</p>

<p>“We can get everything but a first baseman,”
said Bud Bradley, thinking quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I can take care of that,” said
Merry. He remembered that Owen Clancy
was at Fardale, and his chum could be induced
to come to Carsonville. “So long, then. Billy and
I will get the game, and we’ll expect you right<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
after supper. Bring all the fellows you can get,
and we’ll start practice work in the morning.”</p>

<p>This sudden proposal had been simmering in
Merriwell’s brain for some moments. He knew
that it would be hard for him to get away from
Fardale later in the season, and if these local
players had any talent, there might be a chance
of defeating the Clippers at once.</p>

<p>The group broke up. Merry and Billy set off
together, while the others spread the news
through the town in great excitement.</p>

<p>“We’ve undertaken a big contract, Billy. Let’s
go up and see the colonel now.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” said Billy Mac. “But he’ll want
to bet on the game, Chip.”</p>

<p>“He’ll&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>McQuade explained hastily. It seemed that
Colonel Carson was used to plunging heavily on
his own team, in common with a number of other
men who followed the Amateur League. Some
large sums of money changed hands as a result
of the games.</p>

<p>“If he only knew it,” exclaimed Merry, frowning,
“that will hurt his chance of ever buying into
a big-league team. That sort of a man is not
wanted in baseball to-day. However, we’ll see if
he’s willing to play us.”</p>

<p>The two friends wended their way to the large
white house occupied by Colonel Carson. They
were met at the door by that gentleman, in person,<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
who did not ask them inside, but stiffly inquired
their business.</p>

<p>Merriwell stated it, saying that he understood
the Clippers had an open date on Saturday, and
that he would like to meet them with a pick-up
Carsonville team. The colonel tugged at his
goatee suspiciously.</p>

<p>“What’s your object?” he snapped. “Want
to play for the gate receipts?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Chip. “We just want to play
the Clippers off their feet, and we intend to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the other. “Got a mighty
good opinion of yourself, hey?” His face cleared
suddenly. “Mebbe you’d like to make a little
side bet, you or Billy?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” returned Merriwell. “I don’t
gamble, and I don’t think Billy does.”</p>

<p>“Well, look a-here,” went on Colonel Carson
wheedlingly, addressing Billy. “I know you’ve
got some insurance money, McQuade. You put
it up on this game, and I’ll give you odds, two
to one. How’s that? Ain’t that fair?”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” grinned Billy Mac. “Only,
I’m not in your class as a gambler, colonel. No,
we’re in this just to show up that club of yours,
and do it proper. That’ll satisfy us.”</p>

<p>“But if you won,” persisted the other, taking
no heed of the taunt, “you’d have enough to pay
off that mortgage, and some over!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>Billy wavered, but only for an instant.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” he declared firmly. “If you
want to play us, we’ll make your old team hump
itself. If you’re scared of getting beaten, all
right. Just say so.”</p>

<p>“What! The Clippers scared o’you!” Colonel
Carson laughed scornfully as he eyed the two.
“Well, I guess not! It’s a go. The reg’lar umpires
will be here, anyway, so I guess we can
use ’em?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Merriwell. “We may have
the ball park for practice?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” retorted Colonel Carson. “Get
your own practice ground. Mebbe you had a notion
I’d lend you uniforms!”</p>

<p>“No, we’d hate to play in Clipper uniforms,”
returned Merry gravely.</p>

<p>Colonel Carson was not quite sure how to take
that remark, so he let it pass.</p>

<p>“Too bad you’re scared to bet on yourself,”
he said cuttingly. “Got any battery picked out
yet?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be it,” said Billy, with a grin. “Merriwell
pitches for Fardale, you know.”</p>

<p>“Humph! And you’ll do the ketchin’, hey?
Well, I don’t wonder that you fellers don’t want
to bet, then!”</p>

<p>Merry flushed a trifle.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, Colonel Carson. I don’t believe
in betting on principle. And especially<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
where baseball is concerned. It’s an unhealthy
element to drag into the game, and the big baseball
men have no use for a gambler, any more
than good business men have.”</p>

<p>This speech caused Colonel Carson to flush.
His hard-lined, unhealthy face took on a most unpleasant
aspect.</p>

<p>“Oh, you think you’re smart!” he observed
darkly. “Young man, I’ve not forgotten what
took place yesterday morning. You’re goin’ to
regret it. I intend to make you so sick of this
town that you’ll never come back to it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Merry easily. “The town looks
pretty good to me, though&mdash;all except the name.
Well, you haven’t said whether we’d get that
game or not.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll get it,” said Colonel Carson.
“We’ll run up such a score on you that you’ll quit
before the third inning.”</p>

<p>“Thanks again,” and Merry chuckled. “Maybe
you’ll change your mind about that. Anyhow,
we’ll make you hump.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the colonel, as if to echo
the last word. “Two-thirty this Saturday. I’ll
provide the umpires, and they’ll be our regular
league men.”</p>

<p>“That suits me,” said Merry, and the two
friends took their departure.</p>

<p>Billy stated that there need be no worry about<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
the umpiring, as that end of the league was in
good hands, and the umpires were excellent men.</p>

<p>“That’ll help a whole lot, then,” said Merry.
“To-day is Wednesday, Billy. We will get
started to-morrow morning. Two days of practice
looks pretty slim, but I guess we can pull
through. Want to get out with your mitt for
signal work this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” cried Billy excitedly. “And I’ll
catch you in a real game&mdash;my eye!”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope we don’t make exhibitions of ourselves,”
said Merry.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CHIP GETS A LETTER.</span></h2>


<p>That evening, the McQuade homestead
thrummed with eager voices. Six of the best
local players, carefully picked by McCarthy, had
gathered. A good many more had offered their
services, but most of these had more enthusiasm
than baseball knowledge.</p>

<p>“We sure need a first baseman,” exclaimed
Spaulding. Merry smiled.</p>

<p>“I wired my chum, Owen Clancy, this afternoon,”
he explained. “He’s at Fardale now, and
has been out West. He’s just getting over a
sprained ankle, but I think he can cover first for
us all right. Now, let’s get down to business and
map things out.”</p>

<p>Billy Mac, of course, would be backstop. He
had been practicing all afternoon with Merry,
and Chip had found that he could ask no better
partner. The lanky Dan McCarthy would cover
third, and looked as if he would do it efficiently.</p>

<p>Jim Spaulding made a bid for the central sack.
He was one of the town players who had been
ousted by Bully Carson, and was correspondingly
bitter against the Clippers. Chub Newton
would take care of short.</p>

<p>“We won’t be a cl-l-lassy-l-l-lookin’ bunch,”<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
announced the little fellow, as he inspected the
ancient and tattered uniform he had brought
along, “but we’l-l-l be right there when it comes
to bal-l-l pl-l-laying!”</p>

<p>“You bet!” chuckled McCarthy, eying his own
faded green shirt and baseball pants. “If I don’t
bang out a two-bagger, I’ll quit tryin’ to play ball,
by gum!”</p>

<p>The outfield would be taken care of by Moore,
also an ex-Clipper; Henderson, who had been a
high-school star two years before, and a tremendously
built young chap named Nippen. This
Nippen was almost a giant in build, possessed
of terrific strength, and apparently had the general
aspect and intelligence of a cow.</p>

<p>He was the one member of the gathering who
did not impress Merriwell as being especially
adapted for baseball. Billy, however, reassured
his friend in a whispered aside that Nippen
would produce the goods.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look up to much, Chip, and he
lumbers around like an overgrown puppy. But
when he lands on the ball, he kills it, and the way
he covers center field is something wonderful
to watch. You wait!”</p>

<p>So Merry smiled and waited. Every one present
displayed inspiring eagerness to work. There
was one thing, however, which troubled Merriwell.
This was the ill feeling which they displayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve got to watch that, fellows,” he said.
“I noticed to-day that you weren’t a bit anxious
to avoid trouble. Now, if we start in to win that
game, it’s going to make the other crowd sore.
They’ll try to get us into a fight and break up
things. I want you to promise me that whatever
they say or do, you’ll keep your heads and
let the scrapping wait till later. We can’t afford
to get rattled, you know.”</p>

<p>All save McCarthy recognized this fact and
readily extended their promise. The lanky third
baseman held back, however.</p>

<p>“If that feller Squint Fletcher gets gay, I’m
goin’ to paste him,” he declared stubbornly. “I
won’t take any talk or any dirty work from him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Merry quietly. “We’ll have
to find another man to cover third, I’m afraid.
We can’t take any chances that way, fellows.”</p>

<p>McCarthy was taken all aback by this. When
he found that Merriwell was in earnest, he
scratched his head and reconsidered.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “I’ll promise not to start
anything like a scrap, no matter what Squint
does. But I’m goin’ to file my spikes, jest the
same. I reckon we’d better make Merriwell captain,
fellers.”</p>

<p>There was an instant shout of agreement.
Chip held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Hold on, everybody! I think that Billy Mac<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
ought to be your captain. I’m an outsider, and
I’m only butting in here, anyhow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” yelled Billy.</p>

<p>“Yeh! You’re it, Merriwell!” chirped Chub
Newton. “I’l-l-l bank on you every time!
L-l-let’s make it unanimous, fel-l-lows!”</p>

<p>Merry’s protests were voted down amid wild
enthusiasm, and he was elected captain of the
pick-ups. Spaulding suggested that they call
themselves the Carsonville Clippings.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Chub. “The Cl-l-lippers and
the Cl-l-lippings&mdash;wow! Won’t Bul-l-ly Carson
be mad, though!”</p>

<p>The name was adopted with a yell of delight.
The meeting was just breaking up when there
was a ring at the doorbell, and Billy returned
with a telegram for Chip.</p>

<p>“It’s from Clancy,” cried Merry, tearing open
the envelope. “Hello! Listen to this, fellows!”</p>

<p>And, holding up the message, he read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Coming on the jump. Ankle fine. Bringing your uniform
and some balls. Arrive to-morrow noon via <em>Hornet</em>.</p>

<p class="center p-1 shiftright"><span class="smcap">Owen Clancy</span>.</p></div>

<p>“What’s the <em>Hornet</em>?” inquired Billy, in wonder.
“There’s no noon train in!”</p>

<p>“That’s Clancy’s car,” laughed Merry. “It’s
an old auto that he took off the scrap heap and
made into a racer, though it doesn’t look up to
much. He brought it with him from the West.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>“I’d like to put him up,” volunteered Spaulding.
“We’ve got lots of room at our place, and
he’d be welcome to stay a month.”</p>

<p>Billy protested, for he wanted Clancy as a
guest himself, but Merriwell knew that two
guests would sorely tax good Mrs. McQuade’s
resources, so he accepted Spaulding’s offer gratefully.
The meeting broke up with the first practice
set for the following morning, Chub Newton
stating that he would get off work easily enough,
as his employer had no love for the Carsons.</p>

<p>Merriwell rather expected that he would get a
letter from his father in the morning’s mail, but
none came. Though he said nothing of it, this
worried him slightly. He had explained to Billy
that he had written his father, asking for the
thousand dollars, and he began to wonder if his
letter had miscarried.</p>

<p>He soon forgot his worry, when the Clippings
assembled on an old diamond used by the high
school. It was in a meadow beside the river.
Three or four old balls were produced, and Merry
at once set to work to get an idea of what his
team could do.</p>

<p>The results were both encouraging and discouraging.
The diamond was rough and uncared
for, so that the infield had a tough time judging
balls, but the base throws were excellent, and
they showed good form.</p>

<p>Merry handed up slow ones, and the batting<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
practice proved that in this quarter his team was
lamentably weak. Chub Newton would bite at
anything. McCarthy faced the plate wickedly,
but his eye was poor on slow ones, and it was said
that Bully Carson did his best work with a fadeaway
ball.</p>

<p>Spaulding proved to be a fair batsman, while
Nippen landed on Merry’s first ball and knocked
it into the middle of the river. Henderson and
Moore did poorly, and, although the three outfielders
showed up better on gathering in high
ones, Merry was not greatly encouraged when he
and Billy went home for lunch.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a tough nut to crack here, old
man,” he remarked soberly. “Can the Clippers
hit pretty well?”</p>

<p>“That’s their strong suit,” gloomily returned
Billy Mac. “They get a pitcher going, and it’s
all off with him. They’re pretty ragged when it
comes to headwork, but they give Carson mighty
good support. Yes, they can certainly hit.
Squint Fletcher leads the league.”</p>

<p>“Slugging doesn’t always mean hitting,” said
Merry cheerfully. “Brace up, old man! We’ve
a day and a half for practice, and we’re going to
improve a whole lot.”</p>

<p>“We’ll need to,” muttered Billy. He halted
suddenly, staring up at the house just ahead of
them. “Hello! There’s a machine standing out
in front!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>“Clancy must have come ahead of time!” cried
Merry.</p>

<p>The two burst into a run. Reaching the
veranda, they found a red-haired young fellow
seated in a rocker. He was talking with Mrs.
McQuade. At sight of Merriwell, he leaped up
and vaulted the railing.</p>

<p>“Hello, Chip!” he cried, wringing Merry’s
hand. “Wow! I’m glad to see you!”</p>

<p>“Same here,” returned Chip. “I see you’ve
already met Mrs. McQuade, eh?”</p>

<p>“We’re old friends by this time,” said Clancy.
“Hello, Billy! I haven’t seen you since last fall.
How’s everything?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” stated Billy, forgetting his
troubles for the moment. “When do we get some
eats, mother?”</p>

<p>“Lunch is all ready,” said Mrs. McQuade, who
had taken a fancy to the red-haired chap already.
“Do you want to bring your stuff inside,
Mr. Clancy?”</p>

<p>Merriwell hastily explained that Clan was
going to stop with Jim Spaulding, and they
turned to examine the load heaped in the vacant
seat of the machine.</p>

<p>This was composed of two Fardale uniforms,
together with a catcher’s mitt, protector, and
mask, and a half dozen balls. On these Billy
pounced with delight.</p>

<p>“Wait till this afternoon, Chip! We couldn’t<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
do much with those old balls this morning, but
we’ll show you something this afternoon! Say,
this looks pretty good to me.”</p>

<p>“Something to eat would look pretty good to
<em>me</em>,” said Clancy. “I’ve been hitting the high
places ever since early this morning. Say, it
certainly did feel good to go out and have your
mother pump water over me, Billy. Reminded
me of days on the farm.”</p>

<p>The three settled down about the table, and
Merry at once launched into a description of
events at Carsonville. Billy and his mother never
tired of watching the bronzed young fellow, who
had been regaling Mrs. McQuade with tales of
his adventures in Arizona, and Clancy polished
off the good things before him with astonishing
rapidity.</p>

<p>“It listens good to me,” he commented, with a
sigh, when, at length, he could stow no more
away. “I hear at Fardale that Billy has developed
into quite a backstop, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Merry. “He’s a wonder, and no
mistake, Clan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my eye!” sniffed Billy. “Just because I
happen to hold on to your double shoots, you
needn’t raise my modesty like that!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t every one who can hang on to them,”
said Clancy. “Oh, by the way, Chip, I came
mighty near forgetting! Your father was at
Fardale yesterday on a flying visit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>And he began to dig excitedly at his pocket,
finally extricating an envelope which he handed
to Merry.</p>

<p>“Your father asked me to give this to you. He
said it would get to you quicker than if he mailed
it.”</p>

<p>Merriwell nodded. With a word of apology to
Mrs. McQuade, he tore open the envelope, half
expecting to see an inclosure. None fell out. He
ran his eye quickly over the letter, and his cheeks
paled a trifle, then he refolded it, and put it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he stood on the veranda with
Billy. Clancy was down in the drive explaining
the hidden beauty of his car to Mrs. McQuade.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Chip? Wouldn’t he let
you have the coin?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, old man,” and Merriwell bit his
lip. “He didn’t think it wise.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">GETTING DOWN TO WORK.</span></h2>


<p>Merriwell drew out the letter and sank into a
chair. While Billy listened, he read over that
portion of the letter referring to the request for
a loan. Chip read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sympathize very deeply with both Billy and his
mother, Frank, and I would be glad to have you read this
to Billy, and assure him of my best regards and wishes.
As to lending you the money, however, I do not think that
this would be wise, for several reasons.</p>

<p>“The first and most important is that it seems to me to
be a poor way in which to checkmate a scoundrel like this
Colonel Carson. I have made inquiries about him, and
find that he had a reputation as a plunger on ball games,
and is wrapped up in the success of his own team.</p>

<p>“I think you have done well in raising a team to defeat
the Clippers, as intimated in your wire to Clancy. I
was going to suggest that very thing. If you and Billy can
beat his club, it would be an ideal way in which to punish
him. I only wish that more of the Fardale boys were
here, so that they could come down and help, but vacation
has scattered them.”</p></div>

<p>“That’s all very well,” interrupted Billy
mournfully, “but licking the Clippers isn’t going
to save this house for mother, Chip. I wish&mdash;I
wish we’d taken a chance on it, and taken up that
bet he offered!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” exclaimed Merriwell. “Hold
on, Billy. I haven’t finished yet.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Go ahead and whip Carson’s team, Frank. You and
Billy and Clancy can do it if you try, and remember that
I’ve every faith in all of you. Do it, and I will see that
Billy and his mother do not lose the roof over their heads.</p>

<p class="center p-1 shiftright">Your loving father,<br />
<span class="smcap" style="padding-left:8em">Frank Merriwell, Senior</span>.”</p></div>

<p>Merry looked up to meet his friend’s startled
gaze.</p>

<p>“What does he mean by that, Chip?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” said Merry, as he stowed away
the letter. “But you can be sure that father
means something, all right.”</p>

<p>“I guess he does,” rejoined Billy, new hope
dawning in his eyes. “My eyes! It’s a promise,
Chip! I’ll bet he means that if we beat the
Clippers he’ll lend you the coin!”</p>

<p>“No,” and young Merriwell shook his head
decidedly. “He doesn’t think it a good plan, old
man, and that ends it. Father doesn’t have to say
a thing twice. Yes, it’s a promise, I imagine. I’ve
no idea what he means by it, of course, but he
has some kind of plan up his sleeve. You quit
worrying.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” said Billy, with a sigh. “But I wish
he’d said something a little more definite than
that.”</p>

<p>“So do I, Billy,” confessed Merry. “He didn’t,
so there’s no use wondering. I’m not going to<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
say anything to Clan about this business, so now
let’s go around to Jim’s house with him, then
we’ll get out to the ball field again.”</p>

<p>Merriwell decided that the McQuades’ trouble
was a personal affair. He had entered into it
largely through accident, and he did not consider
it a matter to share even with Clancy. So all
three of the friends piled into the <em>Hornet</em>, Billy
standing on the running board, and they made a
triumphal progress to the Spaulding residence.</p>

<p>Despite his unbounded confidence in his father,
Chip could not help feeling disappointed over that
letter. However, the definite promise at the end
served to relieve his anxiety, to some extent, but
he could see no light upon the subject. How could
his father prevent Colonel Carson from carrying
out his threats?</p>

<p>As he obtained no answer to this mental
query, Merriwell tried to forget the whole thing,
and trust that his father knew best. But it was
no easy matter.</p>

<p>That afternoon they met the other Clippings on
the village green, going from there to their practice
ground. Chub Newton had been given a
vacation until Saturday night, and his employer
had promised that if the Clippers were beaten,
Chub would get full pay.</p>

<p>In fact, the entire town was already plunged
into excitement over the sudden contest. Public
disapproval of Bully Carson had long simmered<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
beneath the surface, kept under cover by the influence
and general fear of Colonel Carson.</p>

<p>It was not yet daring enough to show itself
openly, but it peeped forth in minor ways. Every
one knew that Billy McQuade, prompted by his
guest from Fardale, Chip Merriwell, had dared
to defy Colonel Carson. Also, that half a dozen
of the town’s best local baseball talent had joined
the two friends.</p>

<p>Consequently, the grocer’s son, who was taking
Chub Newton’s place behind the counter temporarily,
ran out with a bag of apples and deposited
them mysteriously on the ground by the
astonished Clippings. A little later, as they
passed the one ice-cream parlor in the place, the
proprietor appeared suddenly and thrust a paper
bucket of ice cream into Spaulding’s hand, then
vanished without a word.</p>

<p>By such tokens as these, Frank and his friends
soon discovered that they were not without secret
good wishers, though none of the latter dared
come into the open.</p>

<p>“Talk about a scared town!” laughed Clancy,
munching an apple vigorously. “Looks like your
friend Carson had this place buffaloed for sure,
Chip!”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s good reason for it,” explained
Spaulding. “The colonel owns the bank here,
and pretty near half the farms and orchards
around. If he said to smash a merchant, that<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
merchant would be apt to smash. I know, because
he’s done it before this, and he’d do it
again.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty poor kind of influence to hold
over people,” declared Frank. “I’d hate to walk
down the street and know that nine out of ten
people hated me in their hearts.”</p>

<p>“The colonel doesn’t know it. He’s got too
much vanity. And he wouldn’t care very much
if he did realize it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Somebody ought to l-l-lam him good,” piped
Chub. “I’d l-l-like to see him run out of town!”</p>

<p>“Maybe you will some day,” growled McCarthy
ominously.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget your promise,” said Frank, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“No danger o’ that, Merriwell. I filed them
spikes o’ mine, though.”</p>

<p>“See here, Dan, I don’t want to have any of
that work&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’ to start anythin’, I said,” broke
in the lanky youth doggedly. “And I won’t. But
I ain’t goin’ to let trouble hit me over the ear,
you bet. I’ll be jest as meek as a lamb until they
try dirty work on me, only I want to be ready.”</p>

<p>Frank nodded. After all, he did not greatly
blame McCarthy for distrusting the caliber of
Squint Fletcher, or, for that matter, the rest of
the Carsonville club. He did not believe in fighting<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
fire with fire, but he saw that it would be
useless to try argument with Dan McCarthy.</p>

<p>So he let the matter drop, confident that the
lanky third baseman would not be the first to
start any “dirty work.” The general sentiment
of the Clippings was that the Clippers would not
stop at anything to win, but that the umpiring
would be fair.</p>

<p>“I want you to help me out, Clan,” said Frank,
as he walked along beside his old chum. “These
chaps are just aching for a good chance to start
a scrap with the other team. They’ve all promised
me that they’d go slow during the game, but
I want you to get after ’em during practice.”</p>

<p>“In what way, Chip?”</p>

<p>“By showing them how necessary it is that
they keep their heads. That’s our only hope. If
our boys get rattled, the Clippers will walk away
with us. Impress on them, Clan, that, no matter
what provocation they get, they have to keep
quiet while the game is on. What happens later
doesn’t concern me.”</p>

<p>Clancy grinned. “All right. Count on me,
Chip.”</p>

<p>Upon reaching the practice grounds, Merry at
once sent the men to their positions. He took the
bat, and for half an hour gave the entire team a
driving practice work-out. The new white balls
seemed, oddly enough, to put new heart into his
team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>It showed them that Frank and Clancy meant
business. It was a little thing, but it is just such
little things that count tremendously. The red-haired
chap covered first like a demon, scooping
up everything that came his way. His example
fired the others.</p>

<p>As Billy had foretold, the Clippings seemed
like a different set of players. They went after
the ball with a vim. Spaulding, Chub, and
McCarthy tackled anything, and managed to
smother the stiffest ones Frank drove at them.</p>

<p>In the outfield, the marvelous fielding of Nippen
astonished Merriwell. The gigantic, overgrown
fruit picker, in his lumbering fashion,
fairly ate up the ground. When he went after a
high one, he seemed never to know where it would
fall, but when it came down, it invariably plunked
into his mitt. He had no science, but he seemed
to have luck.</p>

<p>“How do they strike you?” inquired Merry,
as he and Clan conferred during a brief rest.</p>

<p>“Pretty promising bunch, Chip. But when
they get up against those Clippers, it’ll be a whole
lot different. Those fellows can do in their sleep
what this crowd has to break their necks over.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, but, just the same, they’ll improve
a lot by Saturday.”</p>

<p>Clancy shook his head doubtfully. It was clear
that he was not greatly impressed by the Clippings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>The batting practice that followed served to
back up Clancy’s opinions. Calling in the outfielders,
Frank kept putting over nothing but outs
and ins and straight fast ones, yet the batters
could not seem to connect.</p>

<p>His coaching helped them a good deal, but
nothing wonderful resulted. Nippen seemed to
have spent all his energy on the one ball he had
struck that morning. Chub Newton could hit
nothing. Henderson was afraid to stand up to
the plate, and Billy McQuade seemed to have
lost his batting eye.</p>

<p>McCarthy, however, fell on the ball, and
pounded it viciously until Frank served him up
slow floaters, when he failed lamentably. Then
Merry put Billy through his paces as backstop,
using everything from the double shoot to the
jump ball; and the work-out was over.</p>

<p>“It’s a bum lookout,” observed Billy, when they
were walking together past the orchard to the
house. “We did pretty rotten at bat to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not so bad,” said Frank encouragingly.
“We’ll all be nerved up more on Saturday, for
one thing. Then remember, Bill, it isn’t the sluggers
who win.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Chip. Do you honestly think
we’ve got a show?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Frank earnestly. “Our fellows
are fine on base-throwing, and when they get to
work on a decent diamond, the results will be<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
astonishing. I really think we’ve an excellent
chance, old man.”</p>

<p>“Then that takes a load off my mind,” said
Billy, with a sigh. “I thought you’d be pretty
disgusted with us.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled and patted him on the back cheeringly.
But in his heart he felt that, while the
Clippings might have a chance, it was a terribly
slim one.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">COLONEL CARSON MAKES A BET.</span></h2>


<p>On Friday morning, the day before the game,
Colonel Carson was standing in the lobby of the
Carsonville Bank. He appeared extremely discontented.</p>

<p>“Not a one,” he said disgustedly. “Everybody
in town is scared to bet on them Clippings.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” sneered Bully Carson derisively.
“They’re a bunch of pick-ups.”</p>

<p>Bully Carson wore his most flamboyant attire,
for he would not go to work-out with the Clippers
for another hour. From one corner of his mouth
drooped a limp cigarette.</p>

<p>“Too bad you can’t place a few dollars,” he
went on. “It’d be easy money.”</p>

<p>“Is your arm all right?” inquired the colonel.</p>

<p>“Never better. Hello, who’s that gink?”</p>

<p>The two turned to gaze at the doorway. The
bank had just been opened for business, and, as
things were not very brisk in Carsonville, this
was the first customer of the day. And he was
evidently a stranger.</p>

<p>“Must ’a’ come in on the mornin’ train,” observed
Bully.</p>

<p>He was a well-set-up, quietly dressed man, and
would have attracted little attention save for his
remarkably fine build. A soft crush hat was<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
pulled down over a pair of very keen but pleasant
eyes, and the lower portion of his face was
hidden by a curly dark beard.</p>

<p>The stranger gave a single glance at the two,
and walked to the teller’s window. With a nod
and a cheery “Good morning,” he drew out a long
bill book and opened it. Colonel Carson gasped
and clutched at his son’s shoulder, for the bill
book appeared to be crammed with yellowbacks.</p>

<p>“I have a couple of certified checks I’d like
you to cash for me, if you will.”</p>

<p>His voice was quiet and self-restrained.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” replied the teller.</p>

<p>The stranger shoved the two checks he had
taken out through the window. The teller
glanced at them, and his jaw fell. He excused
himself, then beckoned to Colonel Carson to
come over.</p>

<p>“These are pretty large checks, colonel,” he
said apologetically.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Carson, and turned to the
stranger. “Made out to John Smith! Is that
your name?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t those checks sufficient warrant?”
smiled the stranger. “They’re certified, and
ought to be as good as gold, Colonel Carson.”</p>

<p>“You know me?” The bank owner looked surprised.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of you,” returned John Smith
pleasantly. “You see, I’m quite a follower of<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
baseball, though I don’t often get away from
home. I’ve heard a good deal of the Carsonville
Clippers, and came over to have a look at
them.”</p>

<p>Bully Carson swelled visibly. His father
turned to the teller.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I guess. Two thousand is a
big sum, but they’re certified. Mr. Smith, meet
my son. He’s the pitcher o’ the Clippers. Goin’
to stay for the game to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” smiled John Smith. “I’ll see what
the chances are for placing a few bets around
here.”</p>

<p>He winked knowingly, and Colonel Carson
flung Bully a warning glance.</p>

<p>“We got an awful tough team to go up
against,” he said, tugging at his goatee. “I’d like
to bet on the Clippers myself, but durned if I
don’t think we’ll get beat.”</p>

<p>Bully had caught that look.</p>

<p>“Yes, they got a feller named Merriwell,” he
said dolefully. “I dunno’s I’ll be much good
against him, either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Merriwell! I’ve heard of him often,” exclaimed
the stranger. “By Jove, I’d like to get
a bet down on his team, whatever it is! I suppose
I could see the two teams at work,
couldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll take care o’ you, Mr. Smith,” volunteered
Bully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>He went off arm in arm with the stranger, and
Colonel Carson turned to his teller.</p>

<p>“There’s an easy mark! When Bully gets
through with him, he’ll be ready to put up some
real coin on them Clippings, mind my words!”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson’s confidence in his son was
well placed. Indeed, Bully had no easy task, for
not a soul in Carsonville had any great belief that
the Clippers would be defeated the next day.</p>

<p>The stranger went out to the park with them,
and was pleasantly astonished by the concrete
stands and excellent diamond.</p>

<p>“You have quite a place here, eh,” he observed.
“Go ahead, boys, don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>The Clippers did not appear to mind him in
the least. They went to work, and, after watching
them a little time, the stranger was evidently
well satisfied. Bully Carson seemed to have difficulty
in finding the plate. His infield gave him
wretched support, making wild throws, and letting
the ball tear through them.</p>

<p>His outfield did little better. On the whole,
the stranger was anything but well impressed by
the Clippers, and did not hesitate to say as much
on the way back to town. Bully Carson agreed
that they were in poor shape, but when the
stranger had left him, he congratulated his team
warmly.</p>

<p>“I guess that feller’s hooked,” he observed
sagely, and hastened home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>After casual inquiries about town, John Smith
found his way to where the team captained by
Frank Merriwell, junior, was working out during
the afternoon. As this was their first visitor,
the Clippings displayed no little curiosity, seeing
that he was a stranger to them, but he held aloof
from the diamond.</p>

<p>“Who is he&mdash;one of the umpires?” inquired
Frank.</p>

<p>“Search me,” returned Billy Mac. “He’s a
new one in this burg.”</p>

<p>“It’s a scout for the Phil-l-ladel-l-lphia Ath-l-letics,”
chirruped Chub Newton from second.
“He’s l-l-lookin’ for recruits.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried McCarthy excitedly, taking
Chub seriously.</p>

<p>“Sure, he’s goin’ to sign you on, Dan,” grinned
Spaulding.</p>

<p>McCarthy did not see the joke. He advanced
to take his turn at batting, and, when Frank
handed him a stiff inshoot, he fell on it and
knocked the ball through Chub’s hands. Then
Merry began teasing him, but he refused to bite,
until he caught one on the nose and lined it
out.</p>

<p>“Wow? Mebbe that’ll show him what Dan
McCarthy can do!” he yelled, as the ball zipped.</p>

<p>When he discovered that he had been victimized,
he turned on Chub.</p>

<p>“You blamed little yapper!” he said. “You’d<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
be a whole lot s’prised to find that he <em>was</em> a big-league
scout, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yah!” piped Chub jubilantly. “L-l-line her
out again, Dan!”</p>

<p>The stranger hung around for an hour, speaking
to no one, but watching the practice intently.
Finally he drifted off in the direction of town.</p>

<p>Once back in the town, he began inquiries as
to Colonel Carson’s whereabouts. That individual
was not hard to find. In fact, he was
on a still hunt for the stranger, and finally encountered
him near the bank.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Smith, how’d the two teams strike
you?”</p>

<p>“The Clippers didn’t look up to much, to my
mind,” said the stranger easily. “Of course, I
may be mistaken, but Merriwell’s crowd seemed
to be pretty good. Why, one of those fellows
lammed the ball a mile, Carson!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and Colonel Carson fingered his goatee,
“them fellers can hit, Smith. Placed any bets
yet?”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” replied the stranger. “I rather
thought I might induce you to put up a little
money.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t very flush right now,” said the colonel
cunningly. It was not the first time that he and
Bully had worked together to good advantage.
“Still, I dunno as I’d mind placin’ a little on the
Clippers, seeing’s they belong to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, you’re a true sport!” cried Smith heartily.
“Oh, by the way&mdash;I have some friends here
by the name of McQuade. Perhaps you know
where Mr. McQuade lives, colonel?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. He lives in the cemetery, right
now, Smith. He’s been dead quite a spell.”</p>

<p>“Dead! You don’t say!” The stranger was
visibly perturbed. “Poor McQuade! He never
had much head for business. I suppose he died
poor?”</p>

<p>“He died owin’ me two thousand,” said Colonel
Carson grimly. “I got a mortgage on his
place over by the river, right in my safe. I’m
goin’ to foreclose, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! Did he leave any family?”</p>

<p>“Son an’ widder,” jerked the other. “Son’s
ketchin’ on Merriwell’s team.”</p>

<p>John Smith glanced around. The town constable
stood at a little distance, and the stranger
pointed at him.</p>

<p>“That’s the constable, isn’t it, Carson? Well,
let’s bring him into your office, and if we can
make a little bet, he could be stakeholder. Eh?”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson grinned to himself, and agreed
with some show of hesitation. With the constable
following, they entered the bank and sat
down in the owner’s private room.</p>

<p>“Look here, Carson,” said the stranger affably.
“I’ve been thinking this thing over. McQuade
used to be an old friend of mine, and I hate to<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
think of his widow and son being left out in the
cold. I tell you what I’ll do. I’ll set two thousand
dollars against that mortgage you hold.</p>

<p>“If you win, the money’s yours. If the Clippers
are beaten, then I get the mortgage. How
does that sound?”</p>

<p>“No good,” stated Carson firmly. “The McQuade
place is worth a heap more’n that sum,
Smith. I got that mortgage cheap.”</p>

<p>The stranger looked disappointed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked, replacing the bill book
which he had taken from his inner pocket, “I
don’t know that I’m very anxious to bet against
the Clippers, anyway. I’d risk the sum for the
sake of McQuade’s family, out of pure sentiment,
but&mdash;&mdash; Well, I’ll hang about town and
see if I can’t get a bit of money down on your
team. After all, it’s safer.”</p>

<p>He rose, with a gesture of dismissal to the constable.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Colonel Carson. “You ain’t
in earnest, Smith?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course!” said the stranger. “Merriwell’s
team is untried and green. After all, I
might be foolish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Set down, set down,” and the colonel reached
out to his safe. “I’ve got that mortgage right
here. I reckon I’ll take a chance, Smith.”</p>

<p>And once more he grinned to himself.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HOW THE GAME OPENED.</span></h2>


<p>Carsonville was emptying itself.</p>

<p>Every person in town, young and old, was a
baseball enthusiast. The grand stand and bleachers
of the club grounds were invariably crowded
every Saturday. But on this one Saturday it
seemed as though the town had gone crazy over
the game.</p>

<p>So, after a fashion, it had. Despite its support
of the Clippers, Carsonville turned out to
see baseball, rather than to see the Clippers play.
It loved the game for itself. Down underneath
the surface, however, it cherished a warm dislike
for the Clippers and their captain.</p>

<p>This dislike had been, perforce, hidden, for
fear of antagonizing the autocrat of Carsonville.
When the home team had been playing, all personalities
had been forgotten in the game itself.
On such occasions, even Bully Carson had become
popular for the moment, if he won a game.</p>

<p>It was quite different on this Saturday, however.
The Carsons had been defied, and when
the crowd had streamed into the park, it forgot
all about its fear of Colonel Carson’s power.</p>

<p>“I hope them Clippers get trounced! I hope
Bully Carson gets knocked out of the box!” cried<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
old Abner Powell, on whose forty acres the colonel
held a heavy mortgage.</p>

<p>“So do I! Hurray for the Clippings!” yelled
the teller of the Carsonville bank.</p>

<p>“Here’s where the colonel gets took down!”
shouted the Carsons’ hired man.</p>

<p>Every one had forgotten their fears, under the
magic influence of the ball park. And every one
had raised the price of a seat. By general consent,
it was the largest crowd that the Carsonville
park had ever held.</p>

<p>Every man on the two teams was known personally
to the fans, except Merriwell and Clancy.
Even they were known by reputation, though few
of the townsfolk had dared to show support by
watching the Clippings practice.</p>

<p>The line-up of the two teams was announced
that morning by bulletin:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="displayinline" style="margin-right:2em">
<span class="smallfont" style="padding-left:1em">CLIPPINGS.</span><br />
McCarthy, 3d b.<br />
Nippen, c. f.<br />
Clancy, 1st b.<br />
Merriwell, p.<br />
McQuade, c.<br />
Spaulding, 2d b.<br />
Moore, l. f.<br />
Henderson, r. f.<br />
Newton, ss.
</p>

<p class="displayinline" style="margin-left:2em">
<span class="smallfont" style="padding-left:1em">CLIPPERS.</span><br />
Fletcher, c.<br />
Burkett, 1st b.<br />

Johnson, r. f.<br />
Murray, 2d b.<br />
Carson, p.<br />
Runge, l. f.<br />
Merrell, c. f.
</p>
</div>

<p>The diamond was in perfect condition, its caretaker
having spent all morning getting it in shape.<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
Every line was freshly marked, every inch carefully
raked free of hindrances. The very sight
of it was a joy to the fans, empty though it stood.</p>

<p>And it was joy to Merriwell and Clancy, also,
when they arrived at the clubhouse beneath the
grand stand. Both had been too busy to look at
the place, but they were instantly delighted by it.
Meantime, the <em>Hornet</em> proceeded around to the
field with Mrs. McQuade and Jim Spaulding’s
young brother.</p>

<p>“It’s a peach of a place, Chip!” cried the red-haired
chap.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;look at that diamond! I don’t remember
when I’ve seen a better cared-for place.”</p>

<p>Merry continued his inspection as the rest of
his team poured in to dress. There were bleachers
behind first and third, all well filled, and the
only symptom of neglect was in the high board
fence. Directly behind second, in the center
fielder’s territory, there was a strip of fence ten
feet wide that had been leveled. This, it appeared,
had been cut out to erect a large score
board, but there had been delay in the shipment
of materials, and the gap was unfilled.</p>

<p>Billy Mac pointed to the river, which ran about
a hundred yards behind the fence.</p>

<p>“No home runs in this field,” he said, “unless
the ball goes into the river. You see, the diamond
inclosure is a little small, Chip. Outside of
the fence it’s marshy, and it would have cost a<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
lot to fill in. So they compromised on that ground
rule. If the ball goes into the river, it’s a home
run. It’s never yet gone in, though.”</p>

<p>“Queer kind of ground rule,” growled Clancy.
“But there’s no accounting for tastes, so let’s
try to put the ball in the water, fellows!”</p>

<p>“We’l-l-l try,” piped Chub resolutely. “When
do we practice?”</p>

<p>“Right now,” exclaimed Frank. “We’re a little
early, so we’ll get to work and let the Clippers
howl, if they want to.”</p>

<p>When the Clippings walked out, they were
greeted by a long yell from the fans. Then there
rose a buzz of voices as the players trotted out
to their places, and Merry began to drive hot
ones along the infield.</p>

<p>Every one was wondering how the home talent
would show up. No sooner had the ball begun to
snap around the bases than shout after shout
pealed up. Despite their rare and wonderful uniforms,
the Clippings showed form!</p>

<p>Even Frank was surprised. On the level diamond
his team proved that they could do something,
after all. They went after the ball with
ginger, and the way they snapped it up was
astonishing.</p>

<p>The Clippers now produced themselves, and
promptly spread out behind the foul lines to inspect
their opponents. They delivered themselves<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
of comments, which were audible over
most of the field.</p>

<p>“Look at the uniforms!” yelled Squint Fletcher.
“They used them kind fifty years ago! Pipe the
Irish third baseman! Wow!”</p>

<p>“Who’s that scrubby runt playin’ short?” cried
Ironton, waving his fists. “Wait till I land on
him!”</p>

<p>“I’l-l-l show you!” chirped Newton angrily.
“Wait til-l-l&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” cried Ironton. “Wow! He
talks like a washing machine!”</p>

<p>Even the crowd laughed at that, for every one
knew Chub. The little fellow lost his temper,
and sent the ball far over third.</p>

<p>“They’re easy,” commented Bully, in contempt.
“We got their goat already. You watch
when that Merriwell gets up to the plate. I’ll lam
him in the head.”</p>

<p>“You’d better try it!” retorted Clancy heatedly.
Merry signed to him to walk up toward
the box, with Chub.</p>

<p>“You fellows keep quiet,” he said. “Pass the
word around not to give any back talk unnecessarily.
First thing we know, this will be a free-for-all,
and we have to avoid that if possible.”</p>

<p>The Clippings tried to restrain themselves, but
it was hard work for them to keep from answering
the taunts that poured in from Bully Carson’s
men. At length, Frank signed to his team,<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
and they trotted in. The Clippers spread out on
the field, and began to amuse themselves with
threats of what they would do to their opponents,
while they tossed the ball around.</p>

<p>In Colonel Carson’s private box, square in the
center of the grand stand, sat the colonel and
his new acquaintance, John Smith. The latter
had accepted the proffered seat gratefully, though
he refused the proffered stogies, pleading that
his health did not permit smoking.</p>

<p>As the Clippings came in to their bench, they
looked up and saw the stranger.</p>

<p>“There’s your scout, Dan,” chuckled Billy.
“Only it looks like he was friends with the wrong
side.”</p>

<p>The stranger waved a hand at them.</p>

<p>“Go in and win!” he cried. “You’ve got ’em
licked, Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“You bet!” returned Clancy quickly. “Just
watch our smoke, Whiskers!”</p>

<p>The stranger’s white teeth flashed through his
beard, and he turned his attention to the Clippers
as they fell to work.</p>

<p>“They seem to do better than they did yesterday,”
he remarked suddenly.</p>

<p>Colonel Carson leaned back and grinned complacently.</p>

<p>“I reckon they slept well last night, Smith,” he
drawled. “Any team is liable to an off day, you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” returned Smith sharply. “It
looks to me as if you had let me in for a bit of
sharp practice, Carson.”</p>

<p>“Sport is sport,” observed the colonel, with a
grin. “You risks your money, and you takes your
chance.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to call the bet off!”</p>

<p>“No, ye don’t! The constable’s down keepin’
order in the bleachers, and you can’t locate him
’fore the game starts if ye want to. ’Sides, I
reckon you ain’t a welsher.”</p>

<p>The stranger allowed himself to be soothed
down, and settled himself to watch the progress
of things.</p>

<p>Frank and Bully Carson met with the two umpires,
and went over the ground rule regarding a
home run.</p>

<p>“No chance o’ your scrubs gettin’ the ball in
the river,” jeered Carson. “Don’t need to worry
over it. Ain’t never been done, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“That’s no sign it can’t be done,” said Frank,
with a smile.</p>

<p>A gong rang out. Merry and Carson quickly
discussed the question of outs and ins, while the
umpires were announcing the batteries.</p>

<p>“I’d like to git in the box first crack, an’ knock
your block off,” growled Bully. “But I dunno’s
I wouldn’t jest as soon knock you out o’ the box.
Take your choice.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Merry easily. “Since you’re<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
so kind, I think we’ll give you a chance to get a
home run, Bully. According to the batting order,
I’m afraid you won’t get a crack till the third
inning, though.”</p>

<p>Carson, whose name stood seventh on the list,
glowered derisively.</p>

<p>“Huh! We’ll prob’bly bat around twice in the
first inning, you joke! You’d better get another
pitcher warmin’ up.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Bully,” cried Squint Fletcher.
“Leave that poor simp alone!”</p>

<p>No one had any need to hear the umpires’ announcement,
and it was drowned in a roar of
cheers as the Clippings went out to their positions.
Colonel Carson glowered and tugged at
his goatee, then smiled as Squint Fletcher advanced
to the plate amid a mingling of hisses and
cheers. Squint had his backers, who liked him
for his rough-and-ready tactics.</p>

<p>Indeed, it soon developed that the Clippers
were not without friends. The general sentiment
was against them, but there were plenty of
hoodlums and toadies who were willing to cheer
them. Also, many farmers had come in, who
were used to yelling for the Clippers.</p>

<p>The umpires took their positions, and Merry
whipped over three balls to Billy. Squint stepped
up to the plate, with a sneer, and balanced himself
aggressively. Billy Mac signed for the double
shoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>Frank nodded, took his time, and, amid a wild
shriek of delight from the crowd, delivered the
first pitched ball. Squint Fletcher pulled down
his bat&mdash;and there was a crack like a pistol shot.</p>

<p>Squint had landed square on Frank Merriwell,
junior’s, famous double shoot!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CLIPPINGS GET WILD.</span></h2>


<p>The connection, however, was so plainly an
accident, and Squint himself looked so bewildered,
that every one roared with laughter.</p>

<p>The ball went almost straight up in the air over
first, until it seemed to lose itself in the sky.
Fletcher came pounding down the base line, while
Bully Carson, behind first, sent a roar at Clancy.</p>

<p>The red-haired first baseman was not rattled,
however. He calmly stepped back, pulled down
his cap, and waited. The ball came down like a
bullet and stuck in his glove.</p>

<p>“Out!”</p>

<p>Roar after roar of applause went up. The
Clippings, who had been nervous and unsettled,
instantly regained their poise and confidence.</p>

<p>“Take your time, Chip!” snapped Spaulding,
from second.</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket, old man!” cried McCarthy
encouragingly.</p>

<p>“L-l-lam into ’em!” piped up Chub.</p>

<p>Frank smiled. Burkett, who covered first for
the Clippers, advanced to the plate, pulled down
his cap, and waited.</p>

<p>“We’re all behind you, old-timer,” chirped
Clancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>“Let him hit it, Chip!” cried Billy. None the
less, he signaled for an inshoot.</p>

<p>Burkett was plainly anxious to hit. Frank put
over a fast inshoot. The ball fairly smoked with
speed, and Burkett swung too late.</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;uh&mdash;one!”</p>

<p>“Land on him!” yelled Bully Carson. “All
he’s got is speed!”</p>

<p>Billy called for another of the same, but Merry
shook his head. He guessed that Burkett wanted
speed, and would be looking for it, so he put over
a fadeaway that drew Burkett for another strike.</p>

<p>“This fellow’s a cinch!” cried Billy. Burkett
looked determined.</p>

<p>Studying him for a moment, Frank nodded at
the signal for a jump ball. He sent the sphere
down to the plate waist-high. Burkett brought
down his bat, but the ball seemed to jump over
it, and plunked into Billy’s mitt.</p>

<p>“Out!”</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer rolled up, as Burkett sullenly
retreated, and was replaced by Bangs. The
Clipper third baseman was a wiry, alert fellow,
and he chopped down his bat as if ready for anything
that could come along. Merry determined
to let him hit.</p>

<p>So, without pretending to pitch, he merely
tossed over the ball and waited. Bangs gasped,
then struck viciously. Another crack, and the<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
ball went on a bee line to McCarthy. And Dan
fumbled it.</p>

<p>A groan swelled out from the crowd, but it
changed instantly to a cheer. For McCarthy had
picked up the ball and slammed it over to Clancy
a yard ahead of Bangs.</p>

<p>“One, two, three!” yelled the crowd, confident
now that it would see a real game of ball. A
storm of applause greeted the Clippings as they
walked in.</p>

<p>“Rotten fumble,” grunted McCarthy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it!” cried Clancy, slapping
his shoulder. “You retrieved it before it had a
chance to work, Dan. Fine business!”</p>

<p>“You’re up first, Dan,” said Merry. “Now
go in and repeat!”</p>

<p>McCarthy grinned happily, and strode out to
the plate. He waited while Carson tossed over
his warmers-up.</p>

<p>“This pie-eater’s pretty soft, Bully,” snarled
Squint. “Let him hit. He ain’t worth fanning.”</p>

<p>The lanky chap opened his mouth, then snapped
it shut again, and stepped into the box. Carson
eyed him a moment, and the bleachers fell silent
in suspense.</p>

<p>“Speed fer him, Bully,” cried Fletcher. “He’s
scared already.”</p>

<p>Carson nodded and wound up. The ball seemed
to come with startling speed. In reality it was
a slow fader, and it fooled McCarthy completely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;uh&mdash;one!”</p>

<p>Squint returned the ball. Almost without a
pause, Carson snapped over a hot one across the
inside corner. Dan was taken by surprise, and
a second strike was called. It was followed by
a third.</p>

<p>“This bunch of rubes is soft!” chirruped Bangs
from third.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Down they go!” cried Ironton, as
the big Nippen stalked out.</p>

<p>“Who’s the cow?” inquired Murray, from second.
Carson grinned.</p>

<p>“This is an animal show, Bully,” snapped
Squint. “Watch the elephant fan his ears!”</p>

<p>The crowd could not help laughing at the awkward
figure of Nippen. Carson burned a hot one
across. Nippen swung, after it had plunked home.</p>

<p>“Gone to sleep at the switch!” grunted Squint,
while the bleachers roared a storm of advice and
criticism. The big fellow flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“Hit him in the ribs and wake him up!” cried
Murray.</p>

<p>Carson grinned again. He sent over a smoking-hot
ball that forced Nippen to leap back. The
huge fruit-picker looked at him furiously.</p>

<p>“You watch out!” he cried warmly.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Nippen,” exclaimed Merry. “He
doesn’t dare hit you.”</p>

<p>As if to disprove this, Carson launched another
in the same place. Nippen jumped back, and, as<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
his bat fell, the ball struck against it and rolled
out into the diamond.</p>

<p>The big fellow leaped out toward first. Bangs
darted in to secure the ball, laughing as he did so.
He straightened up with it, and slapped it to
Burkett, but a cry of amazement went up. Nippen
had beaten out the throw!</p>

<p>“Watch the elephant run!” shrieked the fans.</p>

<p>Clancy walked out to the plate, while Chub
went down to coach at first.</p>

<p>“Hello, carrot-top!” growled Squint. “Watch
out you don’t scorch the ball on his thatch, Bully!”</p>

<p>Carson knew that Clancy was dangerous. He
put over a fast drop, but Clan refused to bite.
Then came a slow fadeaway, and the red-haired
chap took it on the nose.</p>

<p>There was a groan of dismay. The ball
soared high, and Merrell raced back toward the
fence. Then he stopped, and waited, and the ball
came down into his glove.</p>

<p>Nippen, showing poor judgment, had dashed
for second as soon as the ball settled softly in
Merrell’s glove. The center fielder did not wait
an instant, however, and threw the ball to Murray,
who made Nippen an easy out.</p>

<p>The Clippings were retired. The inning was
over, without a run.</p>

<p>“We’re holding them, fellows,” said Frank
quietly, as they walked out. “Keep up the good
work, and we’ll win, sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll do it, Chip,” cried Spaulding.</p>

<p>“L-l-look out for Ironton,” snapped Chub, as
the Clipper shortstop walked out. “He’s l-l-like-l-ly
to start something.”</p>

<p>Billy Mac evidently thought the same thing, for
he signaled for the double shoot. Merry shook
his head, and compromised on the jump ball.
Ironton struck vainly.</p>

<p>“Hoop-a-la!” sang out Clancy. “He’s going!”</p>

<p>“Let him soak it,” pleaded McCarthy. “We’re
all behind you, old scout!”</p>

<p>Billy called for a fast drop. Although doubtful
of its wisdom, Frank put it across, and Ironton
murdered it. With a clean crack, the ball began
to soar toward center field, and Ironton went racing
toward first.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Nippen!” roared the fans. “What’s
the matter with the elephant?”</p>

<p>The huge fruit-picker stood staring up at the
ball. Suddenly he turned and began lumbering
toward the fence. He did not even look over his
shoulder at the ball, but continued through the
ten-foot gap, while the crowd sent a storm of catcalls
after him.</p>

<p>“He must be going for a swim!” gasped Merry.</p>

<p>“Whoop!” yelled Dan McCarthy. “Look
there!”</p>

<p>Nippen had turned abruptly. The ball was seen
to fall squarely into his glove&mdash;and stick! A wild
roar rose from the crowd, then it died away into<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
a groan, as the base umpire motioned Ironton
to hold third.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” exclaimed Frank,
walking back. “That ball was caught!”</p>

<p>“Outside the fence,” said the umpire. “That
gap shouldn’t be there by rights. It went over
the fence, and Ironton is entitled to his three-bagger.”</p>

<p>“By gum!” yelled McCarthy wrathfully.
“What kind of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quiet!” snapped Frank.</p>

<p>He turned and waved back his angry players,
who were crowding forward.</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty queer decision,” he said,
forcing himself to calmness. “Does it go for
every ball that drops outside the fence?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>Frank saw that the umpire regretted his hasty
decision, but would not change it.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p>The crowd looked at it otherwise, however.
One howl of indignant surprise went up as Ironton
was seen to be safe. The mob threatened to
pour out on the field, and only when Frank was
seen to be taking up his position again did the
fans restrain themselves.</p>

<p>As for the Clippings, they could not understand
the decision. It looked to them like foul play,
though Merry saw that the umpire had not meant
to be unfair. Nippen started to bellow out his rage,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
Spaulding managed to quiet him, and the game
proceeded. But the Clippings had been demoralized.</p>

<p>This became evident when Johnson popped up
a foul. McCarthy went after it, and let it drop.
He made a throw to catch Ironton at the plate,
and sent the ball into the grand-stand wiring.
Ironton scored and Johnson stopped at second.</p>

<p>Frank saw that the balloon was going up, and
wasted no more time. He struck out Murray
with three pitched balls, and then Carson slouched
up to the plate with a wide grin.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” he called cheerfully. “Here’s
where we knock the Fardale wonder out!”</p>

<p>His hopes were not realized, however. Frank
handed him a fadeaway, and Carson swung
vainly. Billy called for the double shoot. Carson
saw the ball break for an in, and brought down
his bat, but the sphere suddenly curved away
from him.</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;uh&mdash;two!”</p>

<p>Mindful of the fellow’s threats, Frank put all
his speed into the next ball. It was a shoulder-high,
straight one, that nipped the inside corner
of the plate. So fast was it, that Carson instinctively
jumped back, then flung down his bat with
a curse. As he did so, Johnson leaped toward
third.</p>

<p>Billy whipped off his mask and slapped the ball
to Dan. The lanky chap took it and slammed it<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
down on Johnson in a cloud of dust. The Clippers
were retired.</p>

<p>“See here, fellows,” pleaded Merry, as he
picked out his bat, “this has to stop right now!
Cool down, everybody. Billy, you work Carson
for your base. Clan, get down to first and coach.
We’ve got to break their streak.”</p>

<p>And Merry went out to the plate, with a badly
demoralized crowd on the bench behind him.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CLIPPING THE CLIPPERS.</span></h2>


<p>“Here’s the boy wonder!” announced Squint
Fletcher. “Soak him in the bean!”</p>

<p>As Carson began to wind up, a voice pierced
the roar of cheers that startled Frank. It seemed
like a voice that he knew well.</p>

<p>“Fardale forever! Hurrah for old Fardale!”</p>

<p>Merry could not tell whence that voice came,
but he gripped his bat hard at the sound of it.
Carson unwound, and a white streak shot toward
the plate.</p>

<p>Whether he intended it or not, the ball came
straight for Frank, who was forced to step back.
Squint grinned.</p>

<p>“Look out for your bean!”</p>

<p>Again Carson sent the ball whizzing down, but
this time Merry connected. There was a crack,
and the sphere went sailing over second, and
Frank went to first.</p>

<p>“Hold it!” cautioned Clancy, as Billy came up
to the plate.</p>

<p>“Here’s the champion human mistake, Bully!”
sang out Squint.</p>

<p>Carson gave Billy a black look and whipped
over the horsehide.</p>

<p>“Ball&mdash;one!” announced the umpire. A storm
of cheers floated across the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>The next ball broke sharply. It struck Billy on
the arm, and the backstop at once flung away his
bat and took first. He gave Frank a grin as the
latter advanced.</p>

<p>Spaulding came up, and Carson fanned him.
The Clippers were evidently waking up.</p>

<p>Moore managed to pop up a weak fly, which
Ironton gathered in easily. Henderson followed,
and struck out, leaving Billy on first and Frank
marooned on second. Two innings were finished,
and the Clippers were one run to the good.</p>

<p>In the third, Merry shut out the Clippers, but,
although McCarthy connected for a long drive,
he was caught trying for third. In the fourth the
heavy end of the Clippers was up, but Burkett,
Bangs, and Ironton fanned in beautiful harmony.
Clancy was up for the Clippings.</p>

<p>“Lay out a soft one, Clan,” said Merry. “This
has been an old-time slugging match so far. Get
to first, and work the hit-and-run.”</p>

<p>The red-haired chap nodded and stepped to the
plate. Carson sent over a wide one, and Clancy
swung viciously, drawing a chuckle from Squint.
Again he swung at a poor one, then Carson lashed
a fast high one across.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the Clippers, Clancy choked
his bat and laid a neat bunt down the third-base
line. So astonished was Bangs that Clancy beat
his throw easily, and Frank came up to bat, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>Carson paused, scowling. He did not like
Merry’s smile, and knew that his speed had not
fooled Frank before. So he wound up as if delivering
a fast one, and his famous slow fadeaway
floated down toward the plate.</p>

<p>Instantly Clancy was sprinting for second.
Merry was not altogether fooled by that delivery,
and he fell on the ball for a short, choppy stroke
that sent the sphere zipping along the ground to
Carson.</p>

<p>The pitcher tried to stop it, but it went through
him. Murray was backing him up, but before the
ball reached first, Merry was standing on the
bag, and Clancy was safe. Roar upon roar
swelled out from the fans; but Frank did not
again hear the voice which had startled him.</p>

<p>Billy McQuade strode out and pounded the
plate with a determined air. Carson fooled him
twice with a slow fader, and, at the second strike,
Merry gave Clancy the signal for a double steal,
doubting whether Billy could connect.</p>

<p>As Carson unwound, the two sprinted for third
and second. Billy saw the movement, and stepped
forward desperately. He managed to bunt, and,
although he was nailed at first, Clancy and Frank
were safe.</p>

<p>It seemed as though they would remain safe,
however, for Spaulding put up a foul tip that was
easily smothered by Squint Fletcher. Moore came<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
up, and as he was a notoriously weak batter,
Frank gave his chum the signal to steal.</p>

<p>Clancy grinned, ready for anything. Carson
kept him close to third, but, as the big pitcher
wound up again, Clancy went toward home like
a streak. Instantly Carson let the ball fly.</p>

<p>Moore, however, knew his business. He was
in his box, and, although Squint yelled at him to
get out of the way, he stepped forward and bunted
the ball along the first-base line. Clancy came
sliding to the plate in a cloud of dust, and the umpire
motioned him safe, Moore, in the meantime,
getting to first.</p>

<p>Squint at once moved for a new trial, but the
umpire denied the motion, and the Clippings and
their admirers sent up a shrill yell as they knew
the score was tied. During the argument Frank
stole third, but an instant later Moore was caught
off first, and the inning was over, with the score
tied.</p>

<p>The fifth, sixth, and seventh passed without
another run. In the eighth, Runge took third on
a long fly, which Henderson dropped, but he died
there. Henderson made good his error by a hit
in the next half, and Chub Newton astonished
every one by getting another, but the Clippers
woke up and effected a beautiful double play that
retired the side.</p>

<p>The ninth opened with the heavy end of both
sides at bat. The crowd was now silent and tense,<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
for the game was apt to jump either way without
warning. Merriwell seemed airtight, and Carson
had superb support behind him.</p>

<p>Squint Fletcher strode up to the plate, and came
down on the first ball Frank put over. The hit
was a clean one, the sphere flying out between
Moore and Nippen for a Texas leaguer, but
Squint was not content with this. He tore around
first and went on to second like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>Moore sent the ball in to Spaulding perfectly.
The second baseman stood off the line, and, as
he stooped for the catch, Squint came slamming
into him in a whirl of dust. The ball was seen
to drop, and, when the dust cleared off, Spaulding
was fiercely addressing the grinning Squint,
whose spikes had gone into his leg.</p>

<p>“Rotten! Murder him!” went up the yell.</p>

<p>“Dirty work! Smash him, Jim!” cried McCarthy.</p>

<p>Spaulding was about to obey, when Chip Merriwell
leaped on him and restored him to sanity.
Muttering, the angry Spaulding wiped the blood
from his leg and limped to his place. Frank returned
to his box, glad that trouble had been
avoided.</p>

<p>Burkett fanned, but Bangs clipped a high one
that Moore misjudged. Squint was halted at
third, while Bangs took second on a close decision,
with one out. Ironton came up and deliberately
stepped into Merry’s double shoot, but did it so<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
cleverly that the umpire was deceived into giving
him a base. The sacks were filled.</p>

<p>The next man up was Johnson. Frank fooled
him once, then snapped the ball to Clancy in an
endeavor to catch Ironton. The effort failed, but
Squint Fletcher took a chance on reaching home.</p>

<p>Clancy sent in the ball far ahead of him, and
Squint turned to get back to third. As he did so,
Billy put the ball into McCarthy’s hand. Squint
gave a yell and flung himself at Dan feet first, in
an undoubted effort to spike.</p>

<p>A shout of anger burst from every man on the
field. The lanky McCarthy was not so easily
caught, however. As Squint came at him, he
writhed aside and drove down his fist with the
ball into Fletcher’s face.</p>

<p>Squint was knocked a yard away, and rose
with a yell of wrath, blood streaming from his
nose. McCarthy was only too ready to pitch into
him, but Bully Carson dragged his backstop
away, and Merry caught Dan by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You paid him out for spiking Jim,” cried
Frank. “Now simmer down, Dan.”</p>

<p>Squint was greeted with howls and catcalls as
he came in. But, during the storm, Bangs had
stolen third, and Ironton had taken second.
Frank gave Johnson a fast high one, and Johnson
hammered it for two sacks.</p>

<p>Murray fanned, but the evil was done. The<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
score stood three to one, and the Clippings
seemed lost when McCarthy came out to the
plate and went out on a high fly. The crowd began
to stream away from the field.</p>

<p>Nippen lumbered up to the plate, and, with a
grin, Carson handed him an out. A shriek of
astonishment went up as the huge fruit-picker
connected. The ball went up and up, and the
Clipper outfield raced back. Then they halted in
dismay.</p>

<p>Silence fell on the crowd&mdash;broken by a gasp.
Nippen passed second, rounded third, and held on
home. The ball not only cleared the fence, but&mdash;dropped
into the river! The huge outfielder had
knocked a homer!</p>

<p>When the fans understood what had happened,
they went wild. Amid the confusion, Clancy
came to bat and rapped out a single. The field
became a bedlam. Shrieks and wild yells rose
on every side, and the thump of feet rose into a
dull thunder. When Merry came out to bat, the
entire crowd went crazy all over again.</p>

<p>As for the Clippers, they were thunderstruck.
Carson tried to gain time, but the umpire commanded
him to play ball, and he threw a vicious
one straight at Frank’s head. Merry calmly
stepped back and bunted it toward first.</p>

<p>Carson leaped for it and fumbled. Clancy
sprinted down to second, and, before the big
fellow could decide where the ball ought to go,<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
Merry was safe on first and Clancy was taking
third.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you bonehead!” growled Squint, as
he walked out and met his captain. “Say, you’re
the limit!”</p>

<p>“He’s l-l-limited, al-l-l right!” chirruped Chub,
from behind third. “The bal-l-loon’s gone up,
fel-l-lows! Tag al-l-long!”</p>

<p>Carson scowled as Billy Mac faced him.
Frank seized his chance and went down to second.
Again the crowd lost its head with delight,
yelling and stamping in a frenzied manner.</p>

<p>“Finish it up, you bonehead,” grated Squint.
“Fan this man and we have ’em.”</p>

<p>Billy laughed. A moment later the ball came
down, and he cracked it squarely. It shot back at
Carson like a bullet. The big fellow leaped aside
amid a yell of derision, and, before Murray had
fielded it, Clancy and Merriwell had crossed the
plate.</p>

<p>The Clippings had clipped the Clippers!</p>

<p>Merry and Billy reached the shelter of the
dressing room first, but the rest of the team was
caught by the frenzied crowd. As the two entered,
they found the black-bearded stranger
waiting for them. He held out a paper to Billy.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, with a laugh, “is something
for your mother, Billy. I think you won it pretty
fairly, old man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>The stranger caught at his beard, and it came
off in his hand. Chip took one glance, then leaped
for him with a yell.</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>And Frank Merriwell, senior, smiled quietly
as he took Chip’s hand.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BEATEN AT HIS OWN GAME.</span></h2>


<p>“Now, boys, I owe you a word of explanation.”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell, senior, faced the victorious
Clippings, who were lined up around Mrs. McQuade’s
extended dinner table.</p>

<p>“I want you to know why I did this. It wasn’t
to gamble, as most of you know that I don’t
countenance that so-called sport for a minute. It
wasn’t to fight Colonel Carson with his own
weapons. That’s another thing I don’t believe in.</p>

<p>“But I do enjoy beating a man at his own
game, when I can do it cleanly and make him
learn a lesson. Now, in plain words, I knew
that Colonel Carson was little short of being a
crook. When he gambled, he wanted to gamble
on a sure thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” went up a murmur.</p>

<p>“But I did not make this bet with him in the
prospect of winning money. I made it in order
to get that mortgage from him&mdash;that mortgage
which my good friend, Mrs. McQuade, had the
pleasure of burning just before dinner. He had
obtained it legally. Then he had been paid for it.
By some mischance, Mr. McQuade had not obtained
it, and had no receipt to show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“Colonel Carson produced it after his death,
and claimed that he had never received payment.
He intended to oust Mrs. McQuade from this
house on Monday. If she had borrowed the
money and paid it off the second time, Carson’s
villainy would have triumphed. This I did not
want to see.”</p>

<p>He paused, his grave eyes sweeping from face
to face.</p>

<p>“As I wrote you, Frank, that would be a poor
way to defeat him. So I came to Carsonville
myself, in disguise. The worthy colonel tried to
entrap me into betting against his team. I appeared
to fall into the trap, and wagered my
money against his mortgage. He tried to induce
me to bet against his money, but this I
would not do. I want you to get the difference,
and get it clearly.”</p>

<p>“I do, father,” exclaimed Chip quickly.</p>

<p>One after another the rest nodded assent.</p>

<p>“What would you ’a’ done if you’d lost?”
queried McCarthy.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell, senior, smiled.</p>

<p>“I watched you at practice work, Dan, and
felt sure that I couldn’t lose.”</p>

<p>At this retort a yell of delight went up, and
Dan flushed and wriggled in his chair. The
speaker went on quickly:</p>

<p>“Are you sure, all of you, that you get my<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
point? I’m not defending betting, even in a
righteous cause, mind; it is demoralizing, and
every sport in which it is allowed is sure to suffer.
Colonel Carson is doing a great injury to baseball
to-day. But in this case I might plead extenuating
circumstances. I was not betting in
order to win. I would cheerfully have let Mrs.
McQuade borrow the money, except that this
would have been knuckling under to a scoundrel.
I won nothing for myself except the satisfaction
of having been of service to a lady whom I am
proud to number among my friends, and to her
son, whom I am proud to number among my
son’s friends.”</p>

<p>And he leaned forward, took up his glass of
water, and, with the warm smile which had endeared
him to so many hearts, proposed a toast.</p>

<p>“To Mrs. McQuade and her hospitable roof-tree!”</p>

<p>A resounding cheer shook the rafters, and the
good lady herself, between tears and laughter,
was unable to respond. But she could not have
made herself heard.</p>

<p>“And here’s another to Frank Merriwell,
senior!” shouted Billy McQuade. Another roar
went up.</p>

<p>“And another to the ‘Chip of the old block’!”
yelled Clancy frantically. Chip held up his hand
for silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“I guess,” he said, looking around with the
smile that was so much like his father’s, “I guess
we’d better call off another to the Carsonville
Clippings&mdash;the picked-up nine that clipped the
Clippers!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“SOUR GRAPES.”</span></h2>


<p>“Too bad about Ted Crockett,” said Garding,
pulling on the weights.</p>

<p>“For Fardale, you mean,” returned Lee Chester.
“Fine for Ted.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” Hunt Garding paused with a sigh.
“Going around the world with his dad, eh?”</p>

<p>“He’s foolish! I’d sooner be captain of the
Fardale nine than go around the world a dozen
times! When does he leave, Hunt?”</p>

<p>“Monday night&mdash;right after the Franklin
Academy game. Say, Chesty!”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Garding dropped his voice with a glance
around. No one appeared to be in hearing, and
he leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Do you think Chip will get it?”</p>

<p>“Get what?”</p>

<p>“The captainship. Ted’s going away leaves it
vacant, you know.”</p>

<p>“Holy smoke! That’s right! By golly, we’ve
got to root for Chip!”</p>

<p>Hunt Garding nodded, but looked doubtful.
He and his brother plebe were among Frank Merriwell,
junior’s, stanchest supporters at Fardale.
In common with many other students, they had
remained at Fardale during the spring vacation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>It was Saturday morning, the last day of the
vacation. Owing to a conflict in the schedules, a
postponed game with Franklin Academy was to
be played off on the following Monday, a half
holiday having been declared by the two schools.
Franklin was Fardale’s ancient rival, and as it
was the second game of the season, feeling was
running high.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Fardale team, its second
baseman and captain, Ted Crockett, was leaving
school. He had been called away suddenly to
take a long trip with his father, but had managed
to postpone his leaving until after the
Franklin game.</p>

<p>His abrupt departure would leave vacant an
important office, that of captain of the nine. It
was of this that the two plebes were talking
in the gymnasium. They did not observe a figure
which stood just around the corner, and which
was that of Bob Randall. He had just emerged
from the locker room, had caught their words,
and was listening for the remainder.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure, Chesty. Chip isn’t certain to
get the place, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know why not!” broke out Lee
Chester indignantly, glaring at his chum. “Why,
he’s the best pitcher Fardale ever had, barring
his father and uncle!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Garding. “Best all-around
athlete, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter with you, then? All
we’ve got to do is to get the fellows on their
toes, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There are several things the matter. First,
there’s another chap on the team who’s a mighty
fine tosser.”</p>

<p>“You mean Bob Randall?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The silent figure around the corner drew back,
with a little smile playing about his clean-cut
mouth. Randall was a handsome, dark-eyed,
fiery-tempered Southerner, who could play ball
like a fiend, when he wanted to.</p>

<p>He was full of pride, and his greatest fault
was his temper. Despite this, however, he was
a prime favorite. At Lee Chester’s next words
his face flushed darkly, and his smile changed to
a quick scowl.</p>

<p>“Randall? Nonsense, Hunt! He’s a dandy
fellow, and is a peach of a pitcher, but he’s not in
Chip’s class.”</p>

<p>“Naturally not, since Merry is a chip of the old
block,” said Garding, with a chuckle. His face
instantly became serious, however.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, Chesty,” he went on. “Bob
Randall is popular.”</p>

<p>“So’s Chip, according to my notion.”</p>

<p>“Sure. There’ll prob’ly be an election right
after the game on Monday. But Chip, Clancy,
and Billy Mac are over at Carsonville, and who’ll<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
look after their interests? You can bet that Chip
will not try to get the captaincy, but he ought to.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose there will be some campaigning
done,” admitted Chester. “But I don’t think
Randall has much show. He’s too hot-headed to
work as captain. Now, look at Chip Merriwell.
Did you ever see him rattled? Not enough to
notice it. He can pitch rings around Bob Randall,
too. Wait till Monday, and you’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Well, you wait yourself. Randall doesn’t
think a heap of Chip, I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there, Garding.”</p>

<p>The two plebes whirled in surprise as Bob
Randall stepped out. With an effort the latter
had wiped the traces of discontent from his dark,
good-looking features.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” he repeated easily. “I do
think a good deal of Chip Merriwell, but since
you seem to be discussing the subject frankly, I’ll
say that he hasn’t any more chance of being
elected captain than you have.”</p>

<p>The two plebes were inclined to be angry at
being overheard by Randall, of all persons, and
much more so by his words.</p>

<p>“Who gave you any license to butt in?”
snapped Chester.</p>

<p>“I happened to overhear what you said, that’s
all. This is a public place, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Generally considered so,” said Hunt Garding,
with a grunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>Randall saw that he had hurt himself with
these two plebes, and he quickly tried to regain
lost ground. He was not the kind to do any disguising
of his true sentiments, however, and
stated his ground bluntly.</p>

<p>“Look here, fellows, you seem to have the idea
that I’m sore on Merriwell. I’m nothing of the
kind. But there’s no use beating about the bush,
after what’s been said, and I’m quite willing to
admit that I want to be captain.”</p>

<p>“We guessed it,” retorted Chester dryly.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no harm in that, is there?” Randall
began to grow warm. “Can’t a fellow contest
an elective office with Chip Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Some fellows could, maybe,” said Garding.
“But if you want it straight, Bob, you’re not the
fellow, in this case. He’s out of your class as a
pitcher.”</p>

<p>Randall’s dark eyes flashed, but he controlled
himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t acknowledge that. Who’ll go into the
box for Fardale when Chip isn’t around? Tell
me that.”</p>

<p>“You will, because you’re the next best
pitcher,” retorted Hunt. “You don’t need to get
sore, Randall. I’m not decrying your ability
when I say that you’re not the equal of Merriwell,
because you’re a blamed good pitcher.”</p>

<p>This only added fuel to the flame, however.</p>

<p>“Well, that remains to be seen,” declared Randall<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
hotly. “Chip gets away with it because he
has luck, that’s all. A whole lot depends on this
game with Franklin, Monday, and the fellow
that pitches and wins the game for Fardale will
be the next captain of the regulars!”</p>

<p>“And that’ll be Chip Merriwell, for he’ll surely
pitch,” said Chester.</p>

<p>“He won’t!” cried Randall, losing his temper.
“I’m slated for that game, and I’m going to show
you fellows what a real pitcher can do when he
gets started. The trouble with a lot of you
plebes is that you truckle to Merry because his
father and uncle are old-time diamond stars!”</p>

<p>Lee Chester showed his wrath at this charge.</p>

<p>“I guess that lets you out,” he exclaimed
angrily. “You’re so blamed jealous that your
brains are twisted, Bob Randall! Nobody gets
truckled to around this school, unless he’s got the
goods, and you’re a long ways from having
them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should hope so!” flashed back Randall.
“I’d hate to have a crowd of decent fellows
thinking that I was a little tin god on
wheels! That’s what you seem to think about
Merry.”</p>

<p>“Better take it easy, Bob,” advised Hunt
Garding, with a frown. “Go out and cool off,
and you’ll see it differently.”</p>

<p>“I see it well enough, thanks,” snapped Randall
furiously. “It isn’t hard to see that a bunch<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
of you fellows toady to Chip Merriwell because
you think it’s going to get you something. That
chap is overrated. He’s got ability, but it’s your
crowd that has given him such a case of swelled
head that he thinks he can cop off everything.
He’s going to find that he can’t.”</p>

<p>“Aw, go away and sneeze! Your brain’s
dusty!” jeered Chester.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you two something!” cried Randall,
shaking his fist and advancing a step. “We’re
going to win this game on Monday, and I’m
going to do it! Look at the team&mdash;it’s all shot
to pieces! Billy McQuade has left school. Crockett’s
going to quit. Clancy is off with Merry at
Carsonville, instead of being back here practicing
to get into shape to cover first. What kind
of a captain would Chip make, when he allows
this on the eve of an important game, tell me
that?”</p>

<p>“He’d make a better one than you would, losing
your fool head this way,” retorted Chester.
“He’s at Carsonville trying to persuade Billy Mac
to return, and you know it! Say, if I had that
jealous disposition of yours I’d hang it on the
back fence and throw stones at it! You make me
tired!”</p>

<p>Randall’s temper lashed out. His face went
white with anger.</p>

<p>“Yuh impudent little Yankee!” he roared.
Whenever he forgot himself his voice took on a<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
soft Southern drawl, which it now assumed
abruptly. “I reckon I’ll teach yo’-all somethin’
right heah! I’ll show yo’-all yo’ cain’t talk to a
Randall like he was a low-down niggah!”</p>

<p>He started for Chester, and Chester started
for him with great willingness. Before they
could strike a blow, however, Hunt Garding
dashed in between with a quick warning, pointing
across the gym.</p>

<p>“’Sh-h-h! The athletic instructor’s coming!”</p>

<p>Randall flung a look toward the door, then
sullenly jammed his hat over his eyes and strode
away.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THREE CHEERS FOR CHIP!</span></h2>


<p>On that Saturday evening there was a momentous
discussion under way at the quarters of
Colonel Gunn, principal of Fardale Academy.</p>

<p>It was here that Coach Trayne occupied a
room, and in his room was seated Ted Crockett,
the present captain of the Fardale baseball team.
The two were discussing the future destinies of
the nine.</p>

<p>Crockett was extremely popular among his
teammates. Coach Trayne knew that his influence
would go far toward the selection of a
new captain, and had asked him over for a frank
talk. He had certain information which was
bound to startle Captain Crockett, and which
would startle all Fardale when it was made public.
The coach did not intend that it should be
made public for the present, however.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Villum Kess had seen Crockett
enter Colonel Gunn’s quarters, and the astute
German lad guessed at once that a consultation
was going on regarding the new captain of the
nine. He started off hastily, and bumped into a
dark figure.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” demanded the voice of Lee
Chester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“Kess,” returned Villum, panting.</p>

<p>“Guess?” cried Chester. “Get out into the
light, you dub!”</p>

<p>“Kess!” shouted Villum. “Dot iss vot I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you!” said Lee Chester, with a
chuckle. “What’s your hurry?”</p>

<p>“Vait! You hafe mein vind pumbed avay!”</p>

<p>Villum hung on to Chester’s arm for a moment,
then straightened up.</p>

<p>“Grogett hass yust gone into der house, yes,
no,” he cried excitedly. “Dey vos goin’ to elegtion
a gaptain, Jesty!”</p>

<p>“Whew!” gasped Chester. “Looks like business,
eh? Think they’re going to make a choice
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yah, aber ve moost hellup oud Chip. I should
faint fits oof dey bicked any one else. I bet
you’ve moost get der poys togedder und root!”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re not so far off, old scout!” exclaimed
Chester. “Come along! We’ll settle
Randall’s hash right here!”</p>

<p>And the two disappeared in hot haste.</p>

<p>The captain and coach of the Fardale nine
were engaged in animated discussion, while Villum
Kess and Chester were getting to work.
Captain Crockett was learning something that
carried dismay to his heart, for the success of
Fardale was very dear to him, and it looked as
though Fardale’s hopes were going glimmering
for that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid I have bad news for you, Ted,”
said Coach Trayne gravely. “I suppose you
know that Frank Merriwell, senior, ran over from
Bloomfield last Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the perplexed Crockett. “I
know he made a hurry visit, and I supposed that
it had something to do with Clancy’s jumping off
for Carsonville.”</p>

<p>“Not altogether. He came over to make certain
arrangements, and to let me know about
something important that has just turned up.
Mr. Merriwell gave me permission to use the information
at my discretion. I suppose you will
regard it as confidential if I pass it on to you,
Crockett?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, sir!”</p>

<p>Crockett sat up, his eyes beginning to bulge.
He knew that something serious had come up,
for it was seldom that Coach Trayne used his
“business tone” when off duty.</p>

<p>“I hope that nothing really grave has happened,
sir?”</p>

<p>“You can judge for yourself, Ted. We’re
likely to lose the services of Chip Merriwell for
the rest of the season.”</p>

<p>“Wh-a-a-t!”</p>

<p>Crockett stared at the trainer as if he thought
the latter’s senses had taken flight. Lose Chip
Merriwell, just when Fardale was counting on
sweeping all her foes before her! Impossible!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“Are you joking, Mr. Trayne?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say that I’m not,” returned the
worried trainer. He sighed, for he, too, had had
visions of what his team would do with Merry
in the box.</p>

<p>“No, it’s anything but a joke, Crockett. I am
not at liberty to say very much, and in fact I’m
not aware of the definite reasons myself, but the
fact remains that Chip may leave school before
long.”</p>

<p>“But why?” queried the astounded captain of
the nine. “He’s not sick or anything, is he?”</p>

<p>“No. As I understand it, his father and uncle
are going West, and intend to take Chip with
them. Mr. Merriwell did not go into details, but
it’s easy to imagine that it must be something of
importance to necessitate Frank’s leaving school
at this juncture. It’s going to be a hard blow
to the team, for he was the mainstay.”</p>

<p>Crockett nodded. He was absolutely unselfish,
and realized fully that much of the school’s success
in sports was due to Frank Merriwell,
junior.</p>

<p>“That’ll be awful news to get out!” he murmured.
“It’s going to jar things on the campus,
all right!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let it out for a while,” went on
the coach. “I’ve told you about it because I
wanted to ask you who you had in mind to fill
your position when you leave. I’d like to have<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
the election held right after Monday’s game, if
possible.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Crockett gloomily, “if you
hadn’t told me this, I’d have said that Chip himself
was the man. He’d make a better job of it
than I would, in fact. But since he’s going to
drop out also, I’d say Bob Randall.”</p>

<p>“Randall? Yes, he’s a good man, Ted. But if
Chip does leave, isn’t that the very reason why
he ought to be elected?”</p>

<p>“Huh! I don’t get you,” said Crockett, his
mind in a whirl.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” smiled Coach Trayne: “Frank
has done a whole lot for the school, and for the
baseball team. It’s not settled that he’s to leave,
remember; but I think that whether he does or
not, the school ought to avail itself of the chance
to give him honors while it can.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” assented Captain Crockett
quickly. “Yes, I get your angle now, sir. I suppose
he’ll go in the box for us on Monday?
That’ll cinch the game, and it’ll throw everything
his way when I mention to the boys that he
ought to be captain.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad that such is your opinion,” said the
coach, with a breath of relief. “I happen to
know that Randall is moving heaven and earth
to get the election, and&mdash;&mdash; Hello! What’s all
this?”</p>

<p>From in front of the house had risen a sudden<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
burst of cheering. Coach Trayne went to
the window and flung it open. Instantly a renewed
shout went up.</p>

<p>“Merry for captain! Whoop-ee!”</p>

<p>A crowd of students was gathered before the
windows. They had been hastily marshaled by
Chester and others of Merry’s adherents, and
more were assembling at every moment. On the
edge of the crowd, hidden by the darkness, stood
Bob Randall. He was flushed and angry, but he
knew better than to give way to his inclinations
before this gathering.</p>

<p>“Vot’s der matter mit Randall?” shouted the
voice of Villum Kess.</p>

<p>A chorus of groans answered, mingled with
jeers and catcalls. The dark-haired lad in the
shadow clenched his fists and muttered wrathfully,
but he kept himself under control. A roar
went up.</p>

<p>“Chip Merriwell! We want Chip for captain!”</p>

<p>Coach Trayne slammed down the window and
turned to Crockett with a smile.</p>

<p>“Hardly representative of the team, Ted, but
they show the trend of public sentiment. But if
Merry wins Monday’s game, and is elected, what
about Randall?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was thinking,” said Crockett
uneasily. “He’s a splendid chap, except for his<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
hot, Southern temper, Mr. Trayne. He really believes
that he’s as good as Chip on the mound, and
I must say that he’s the best we have after Merry
himself.”</p>

<p>“I understand you,” nodded the coach. “I
think he’s a bit jealous of Merry, and it’s quite
certain that he is anxious to be elected himself.
However, he’s a bit too quick to pick up grievances.
I’d be afraid of him as captain. You
understand, old chap, that I’m not trying to
dictate?”</p>

<p>“Of course, sir,” smiled the captain. “You’re
dead right, just the same. He has the clear-headed
ability to serve as captain, but he’s apt
to lose it all in a quick flash of temper. A captain
has to be a pretty cool sort&mdash;I guess the
only qualification I had for the job was my coolness.
By the way, have you heard from Chip
whether Billy Mac will return or not?”</p>

<p>“No word yet,” and the coach shook his head.
“Things look bad, Crockett. With Billy gone,
Clancy will have to catch Merry on Monday.
Who’ll go to first in his place I haven’t decided
yet. After you go, the team will be badly disrupted,
I’m afraid. When Merry goes&mdash;well
may&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And he flung up his hands in hopeless despair.
Ted Crockett stared gloomily at the window, and
listened to a new burst of cheers that came from
the campus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>As if in answer to these, there came a knock
on the door. Coach Trayne answered it, and
uttered a cry of satisfaction as he received a yellow
envelope.</p>

<p>“A wire, Crockett! Let’s hope it’s from Chip.”
It was not from Merry, however, but from Owen
Clancy.</p>

<p>“Read that, Ted!” cried Trayne, and handed
the message to Crockett. It was brief and very
much to the point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chip won great game in Carsonville. Billy McQuade
returning to Fardale with us. On deck bright and early
Monday morning.</p></div>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Crockett jubilantly. “Billy’s
coming back! Say, may I read this to the fellows,
Mr. Trayne?”</p>

<p>The coach nodded a smiling assent. The news
that the backstop was coming back to school after
writing that he would not return, was a great
relief to him.</p>

<p>Crockett flung up the window and read out the
message. It was greeted with a storm of frantic
cheers. Then he held up his hand for silence, and
after a moment the crowd fell quiet.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Captain Chip!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Another roar of cheers welled up through the
night as the crowd acclaimed this good news.
Then the meeting slowly broke.</p>

<p>With bitter heart and darkening brow, Bob<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
Randall had heard the message read, and had
heard the cheers that followed Crockett’s shout.
He slipped away across the campus and toward
the barracks, a fierce anger welling up within
him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A WILY PLOTTER.</span></h2>


<p>Randall slowly returned home to the barracks.
His heart was hot against Chip Merriwell, and
hotter yet against the crowd who had acclaimed
his rival.</p>

<p>“Confounded Yankees!” he muttered. “Whatever
did I come to this part of the country for,
anyway! Just because I had an uncle livin’ at
Carsonville, I reckon. I wish I had stayed down
home an’ taken a chance on the Annapolis examinations!”</p>

<p>The cool night air calmed down his heated
anger a little, and by the time he reached the barracks
it had changed into a dull despair. It
seemed to him that no one had a chance to rival
one of the Merriwells at Fardale.</p>

<p>Yet Bob was not a bad sort of fellow at heart.
His impulsiveness sometimes led him into hot-headed
errors, which he bitterly repented later.
He had tried to conquer himself, and to some extent
had succeeded. None the less, in this case
he had given way to his bitterness without restraint.</p>

<p>As he reached the door of the barracks he detected
a figure lurking in the shadow to one side.
A keen glance showed him that the figure was
not in uniform, and was one of the village youths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>“Here!” cried Randall sharply. “What are
you doing around here?”</p>

<p>“I’m lookin’ for Bob Randall,” came the surprising
answer.</p>

<p>Randall started.</p>

<p>“You’re not looking for him, but at him,” he
answered. “What’s your business?”</p>

<p>The village youth held out a paper.</p>

<p>“Here’s a message I was to bring you. And
the feller said that you was to keep it under your
hat.”</p>

<p>Randall took it in some wonder, and the youth
darted off. When he reached his room, where
his roommate, Harlow Clarke, was busy over his
books, Bob opened the paper, and read the message
it bore:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Come over to Dobb’s Hotel. Must see you and talk
with you at once. Don’t let any one know you’re meeting
me.</p>

<p class="center p-1 shiftright"><span class="smcap">Your Uncle.</span></p></div>

<p>Randall whistled. His uncle! He had had the
pleasure of meeting that gentleman on his arrival
in the North, and he had not been greatly
impressed by Colonel Carson’s rather uncouth
accents and hard features. Still, Colonel Carson
was his uncle, and had come up from Carsonville
to see him, it appeared.</p>

<p>He turned quickly to his roommate.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go over to town, Clarke,” he said.
“Will you fix the rope in the window so I can get
in without running the guard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, old man,” said Clarke.
“Will you get in before taps?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell yet, but probably not.”</p>

<p>“Well, get along, then. I’ll fix up a dummy
that’ll fool the inspector when he comes to look
at the beds. You’ll find the rope out of the window
as usual.”</p>

<p>Quickly but quietly, Bob left the barracks and
the academy grounds. It was not the first time
that he and his roommate had wanted to come in
after regulation hours, and by the aid of the rope
and dummy this was invariably effected without
much danger of detection and punishment.</p>

<p>Randall found his uncle waiting for him at the
hotel, and was quickly taken to a private room.</p>

<p>“Glad to see ye, Bob, glad to see ye!” he cried
effusively, as he pressed Bob into a chair. “Shall
I send for a drink, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t drink, thanks,” said Randall. “You
must have been in something of a rush to see
me, uncle!”</p>

<p>“Well, might’s well admit that I was,” and
Colonel Carson fingered his goatee thoughtfully
and eyed his nephew. “I hear there’s to be a
game here on Monday?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and Randall’s face fell a trifle. “Franklin
Academy is coming over. It ought to be a
pretty good game. Will you stay over?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe. Hard to say, though, Bob. I know
about them Franklin fellers. I been keepin’ tabs<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
on their pitcher, thinkin’ to pick him up for the
Clippers next year. I wanted to see ye about that
game, Bob.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad some one wants to see me about it,”
returned Randall bitterly. “I thought that I was
going to pitch for Fardale. If I pitched and won,
I’d probably get elected captain afterward&mdash;our
captain leaves Monday night, you know.”</p>

<p>For some reason Colonel Carson looked perturbed.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he prompted.</p>

<p>“But it seems they’ve slated Merriwell to pitch.
That means he’ll do me out of the captaincy.
Everybody seems to knuckle down to these Merriwells
over here. I can’t understand it!”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson looked relieved. He eyed his
nephew keenly.</p>

<p>“I s’pose that if Merriwell pitched, it’d be a
cinch for Fardale, Bob?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a cinch, anyhow,” exclaimed Randall.
“If I got in the box I’d draw rings around those
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m talkin’ about Merriwell. He’d do
considerable more, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>Randall hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied unwillingly. “I’m bound to
say that his very name seems to scare Franklin
out of its boots. Why?”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson tugged at his goatee slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, I figure on gettin’ you in the box, Bob,”<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
he said reflectively. “I want to do a little bettin’
on that game. If it wasn’t for Merriwell, I think
that Franklin pitcher might have a chance to
win.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t do it,” exclaimed Randall quickly.
“If I got a chance at him I’d show him up!”</p>

<p>The older man’s eyes narrowed suddenly.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose you’d throw the game?” he
snapped out.</p>

<p>Randall flushed and sat up. He looked hard
at his uncle, but the latter was smiling. Bob
sank back, with an uncertain laugh.</p>

<p>“I pretty nearly thought you were in earnest,
uncle! Of course, I know you’d never think of
such a thing, though. No, if I can win that
game I’m pretty sure to get the election that will
follow it.”</p>

<p>The colonel tugged at his goatee once more.
He seemed to get all kinds of inspiring thoughts
from that patch of gray hair on his chin. Just
at present his thoughts were anything but inspiring,
however.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him placed,” he was reflecting inwardly.
“He thinks that Franklin feller is no
good. Now, if I can keep Merriwell out and let
Bob pitch, I can go ahead and place some bets
on Franklin. I hate to see Bob get the spots
licked off him, but business is business.”</p>

<p>Aloud, however, he expressed himself quite in
an opposite fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>“Well, nephew,” he said pleasantly, “I’d like
to see ye get a fair chance. It don’t seem to me
like that feller Merriwell gives any one else a
show, does he?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think so if you were here at
Fardale!”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to be here to tell that. If you
go on the mound Monday afternoon, you’re pretty
sure to win, eh?”</p>

<p>“Dead certain,” said Randall. “We’ll have a
bang-up team, and we’ll hand it to Franklin pretty
hot, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it, nephew, glad to hear it. I’ll
see to it that Merriwell does not do ye out o’
your chance.”</p>

<p>“You’ll&mdash;what? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“None o’ your business,” and Colonel Carson,
with a dry chuckle, pulled out his watch. “I got
you placed, Bob. You go right ahead and ’tend to
business. I’m a-goin’ to help out one o’ my kin
when I get the chance, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“But what influence have you with Captain
Crockett and Coach Trayne?”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson gave Bob a look of commiseration.
Was it possible that his own nephew was
so green?</p>

<p>“Not much, I reckon. But I got some influence
with Merriwell. There’s a train out o’ here in
twenty minutes, Bob. It’ll get me to Carsonville<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
before midnight. I reckon I’d better take it, to
make sure. I got a heap o’ things to see to.”</p>

<p>Randall looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“But I thought you’d be here for the game,
uncle!”</p>

<p>“I reckon I will be,” laughed the colonel
quietly. “Now, you lay mighty low, Bob. Don’t
say nothin’ to any one about seein’ me, or about
what I said. But as sure’s you stand here,
nephew,” he went on impressively, “you’ll be the
one to pitch in that game on Monday, mind my
words!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how you’re going to work it!”
said Randall, in some wonder. “If you do, you’re
a wizard!”</p>

<p>“Well, some folks have called me worse’n
that,” said Colonel Carson, with a chuckle, as he
reached for his suit case. “You’ll be pitchin’, and
I’ll be here, and I’m a-goin’ to lay some whoppin’
good bets, let me tell you!”</p>

<p>After Randall had taken his departure, not
knowing whether to feel delighted or dejected
over his uncle’s promises, Colonel Carson
laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll lay some bets!” he chuckled
again evilly. “But it’ll be on Franklin, all right!
I guess you’re goin’ to get a pretty bad lickin’,
nephew&mdash;but business is business. I see where
I get revenge on that cussed Merriwell kid!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A NIGHT ATTACK.</span></h2>


<p>“There’s nothing like being square, fellows.
You can’t beat it, I don’t care what any one says.
It’s not so much whether you win or lose, it’s simply
that you feel square inside. That’s what
Davy Crockett meant when he said: ‘Be sure
you’re right, then go ahead!’ Davy didn’t care
a snap about dying&mdash;he knew he was right, and
he won out!”</p>

<p>“Lecture on history by Frank Merriwell,
senior,” laughed Chip. His father smiled as he
watched the lights of the train flashing up the
valley.</p>

<p>“It’s a fact,” he went on, turning to Chip and
Billy McQuade and Clancy, who had accompanied
him to the train. “I’m not preaching, and you
know it.”</p>

<p>“But Davy Crockett died in the Alamo,” interjected
Clancy doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Sure,” flashed back Frank Merriwell, senior.
“That’s why he won, that’s why he’ll live forever,
Clancy. He knew he was right&mdash;get that?
Defeat is no sign of failure, not a bit of it. This
Colonel Carson, of Carsonville, has been winning
consistently until you fellows turned the
trick on him. Now he’s started in to reap the
whirlwind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>“He reaped it, all right, when Chip pitched to-day,”
said Billy Mac. “He reaped a few double
shoots he didn’t expect&mdash;or, rather, the Clippers
did.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the idea,” said Merriwell, as the
train pulled in. “Well, so long for the present,
everybody. Good luck to you on Monday, Frank!
I’ll try to run down from Bloomfield to see that
game, but I can’t promise. I’ve got some important
affairs on with Dick&mdash;you’ll learn about
them later.”</p>

<p>He handed his grip to the porter and sprang up
the steps. The eleven-o’clock express was already
late, and there was only time for a last
wave of the hand before the train began to move,
then drew away into the night.</p>

<p>“I wish you fellows wouldn’t go to the hotel,”
said Billy, as the three friends started toward
town. “We’ve all kinds of room at home.”</p>

<p>Chip flung his arm over the other’s shoulder,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Billy! Clan and I haven’t had
much chance to get together since he came home
from the West, you know. We’ll have an old-time
gabfest, and will get acquainted again before
we come up to the house to-morrow. By
gracious, these streets are dark!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry now we didn’t come down in the
<em>Hornet</em>,” said Clancy regretfully. “We could
have piled into her somehow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>Late Saturday night in Carsonville was, indeed,
a dark time, especially for the Carsonville
Clippers!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Quite naturally, Colonel Carson and his son
had not taken their beating with a good grace.
Bully Carson was an excellent pitcher, but so
far did Chip outclass him, that he and his father
were furious over the disgrace of being beaten
by a pick-up nine from their own home town.</p>

<p>No sooner was the game over, than they put
their heads together in order to concoct a plan
which would assist them both in humiliating the
Merriwells and in winning a few side bets upon
the Franklin game. Colonel Carson was fond of
gambling, but he usually liked to know beforehand
which way the game was going to come out.</p>

<p>As a result of their conference, the astute colonel
hurriedly caught the late afternoon train for
Fardale, determined to gain revenge on Chip and
his father, and recoup his losses at the same time.</p>

<p>He needed only a lever in order to get his
machinations into working order, and this lever
he found in the person of Bob Randall. Having
discovered that his nephew was not cut on his
own pattern and merely disliked Chip Merriwell
with an open and manly fervor, he had changed
his tactics. Obtaining the information he was
after, he caught the late train back to Carsonville,<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
passing that which bore Frank Merriwell,
senior, on the way. Things were shaping themselves
very nicely, indeed, he reflected.</p>

<p>Meantime, Bully Carson had been busy trying
to obtain his own revenge. During the evening
his team met at the town pool room, which they
frequented the greater part of the time, and
Bully set to work.</p>

<p>Squint Fletcher, his catcher, could barely walk.
Bully passed him up with a scowl, and turned to
the rest of the assembled Clippers.</p>

<p>“We hadn’t ought to let them fellers get away
with it,” he declared cunningly. “They put the
spurs to us right, then they beat up Squint here.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t blown up they wouldn’t have
beaten us,” growled Ironton, the Clippers’ shortstop.</p>

<p>This criticism was quite true. But Bully Carson
was loath to admit it, so he merely frowned
the more.</p>

<p>“If we’d had a little decent support from you
guys,” he snapped, “I wouldn’t have gone up.
How can a pitcher do anything when he don’t
get any support?”</p>

<p>“How can he get support when his balls get
knocked a mile outside the grounds?” snapped
back Ironton.</p>

<p>A general grin went up at Carson’s expense.
It was quite true that when he had started to<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
lose his head, Chip’s men had fallen on him and
pounded the ball unmercifully, and Bully knew it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he insisted surlily, “we oughtn’t to let
’em get away with it, just the same. They’d
ought to go back home so’s they’d know what
they’d been up against.”</p>

<p>A general mutter of assent went up. On this
point, at least, it was evident that the Clippers
thoroughly agreed with their captain.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the process?” inquired Murray,
the second baseman.</p>

<p>Bully gathered them around him, with a wary
glance at the other occupants of the pool room.
He lit a cigarette, got it drooping in approved
fashion from one corner of his mouth, then explained
himself.</p>

<p>“I happen to know that Merriwell’s old man is
goin’ off by the express. I heard ’em say somethin’
about it. More’n likely, the kid and that
carrot top who played first will come down to see
the old man off. It’s gettin’ along toward train
time, and if we went down we’d be liable to meet
them two comin’ back. If the whole crowd’s
with ’em, so much the better.”</p>

<p>“Count me out,” growled Squint Fletcher. “I
got both eyes shut.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t so bad, Bully,” said Ironton. “We
can beat ’em up proper, eh? Guess there’s enough
of us without Squint.”</p>

<p>Bully Carson’s proposal was accepted without<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
any great enthusiasm, but it was decided that
Merriwell and his friends needed a lesson, consequently
they must be given it without delay.</p>

<p>So, after rolling fresh cigarettes, the party decamped
toward the railroad station. There were
six of them, all told, for two had remained to
help Squint Fletcher home, but it was conceded
that six Clippers would be enough to handle Merriwell
and as many of his “gang” as might be
with him.</p>

<p>While nearing the station, which was situated
at some little distance from the center of town,
the train was heard pulling out. Ironton had
hastened ahead, and a moment later he returned
with word that Merriwell and two others were
coming. The Clippers hastily disposed themselves
in a dark doorway.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE INITIALS IN THE HAT.</span></h2>


<p>“Why don’t you finish the year at Fardale,
Chip?”</p>

<p>Billy Mac was distinctly worried. So was
Owen Clancy.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” returned Frank, with
a frown. “Dad only hinted that he and I might
go West. Looked as though Uncle Dick was
mixed up in it, too, but I couldn’t get him to say
anything definite.”</p>

<p>“Looks bad for Fardale if you have to leave,”
remarked Clancy. “We’ll lick the spots off
Franklin on Monday, anyhow. With Ted
Crockett going away, too, the team will be all
bust up for sure.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose there’ll be a new captain elected,”
said Billy slyly.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Chip.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s only one fellow going to nab
that honor, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Who?” inquired Frank. “Randall would be
a mighty good man, and I’d like to see him get
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You old humbug!” cried Clancy. “You’re it,
of course! Why, Chip, if you didn’t get it I’d
never set foot on the diamond again!” He broke<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
off abruptly as he stubbed his toe. “Why don’t
you get some light in your blamed old burg,
Billy?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got shining lights right now if you’d
only take your hat off,” grinned Billy Mac. “But
Clan is right, Chip. Captain Chip, I should say!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Merry. “Of course, I won’t
say that I wouldn’t appreciate the honor, fellows,
but I think that Randall is the one for the place.
Besides, remember, dad talked as if he and I
would go away. I sure hope it won’t come true.”</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, for he had detected a
dark figure lurking against a wall ahead of them.</p>

<p>“Do you ever have holdups here, Billy?” he
went on, in a low voice. “Looks as if that fellow
was waiting for a belated traveling man, eh?”</p>

<p>“No danger,” scoffed Billy Mac, after a glance
at the hulking figure, which remained by the wall
in shadow. “This isn’t a particularly good residence
section, but the constable keeps things
pretty clean around here. No, I sure hope you
won’t leave&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted as the lurking figure
slouched out and barred their path. Chip took
a keen look, but did not recognize the man at
once, for it was dark, and the fellow’s hat was
pulled down over his eyes. Something about the
figure suggested Bully Carson to him, but he dismissed
the swift suspicion that flashed over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>“Where ye goin’?” demanded the fellow, in an
obviously disguised voice.</p>

<p>“That’s our business,” flashed Merry. “Get
out of the way.”</p>

<p>The figure lunged forward with a swift blow.
So rapidly was it done that before Frank could
dodge he felt the man’s fist strike his breast,
flinging him violently back against Clancy. At
the same instant the eager voice of Carson rose
in a low cry:</p>

<p>“We got ’em, boys! Come along!”</p>

<p>Out from an adjacent doorway poured a group
of dark shapes, while Carson flung himself forward
with another blow at Merriwell. Before it
landed, however, Chip had recovered himself,
and he realized the situation in a flash. Darting
under the big fellow’s lunge, he snapped in a
blow that caught Carson full in the mouth and
jarred him to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>“Against the wall, fellows!” he cried quickly.
“We’ll have to fight them off!”</p>

<p>“It’s Carson’s gang,” exclaimed Billy, as he
and Clancy ranged up beside Chip.</p>

<p>“You bet it is,” responded a voice, and the dark
figures closed in on them.</p>

<p>It seemed that there was no hope for the three
friends, as the crowd rushed in at them with furious
blows. Chip, however, had hastily pushed
back into an angle formed by the union of two<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
house walls, where it was difficult for the Clippers
to get at them.</p>

<p>This fact, together with the darkness, rendered
the odds somewhat more even. Carson’s
followers were confused by Merry’s quick move,
and when they came shoving forward in a mass
Clancy stepped out and let fly with his fists.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ironton, trying to get back.
“They’ve got clubs, boys! Watch out for ’em!”</p>

<p>“Quit your crowding,” exclaimed Bully Carson,
to those behind.</p>

<p>He was flung forward, however, and Merry’s
fist cracked into his right optic. Unable to see
what had hit him, he staggered back with a howl.</p>

<p>“Look out fer sledge hammers!” he cried.
“They got some bricks&mdash;get back, you fellers!”</p>

<p>Merry was smiling slightly&mdash;that old, self-confident
smile which spelled danger had the Clippers
but seen it. Before Carson could retreat,
Chip stepped out and followed up his first blow
with two swift punches from right and left. The
big fellow was sent reeling back headlong into
his own men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Clancy and Billy Mac had not been
idle. Taking advantage of their opponents’ momentary
confusion, they had immediately carried
the battle into the enemy’s camp. Every head
was that of a foe, and they struck out with amazing
carelessness as to whether they hurt any one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>Taken by surprise at these bewildering tactics,
the Clippers tried to shove back from the
niche in the wall. Their numbers were against
them, however. Those behind were still trying to
get into the conflict, and the two or three in the
front rank were getting all the benefit of the
three friends’ flying fists.</p>

<p>A fragment of rock crashed against the wall
behind Frank. Flaming with anger at the whole
cowardly attack, he leaped forward with a cry
to Clancy and Billy. Carson met him with an
angry bellow.</p>

<p>The big fellow lacked all science, however. Already
smarting under his punishment, his attack
was futile. Merry’s fists beat a tattoo on his
heavy face, while his own vicious blows merely
beat the air. Once again Chip’s knuckles landed
against his puffing eye, and he measured his
length in the dust.</p>

<p>One of the Clippers had hurled a rock at
Clancy, which had struck the red-haired chap on
the shoulder and staggered him. He recovered
instantly, however, and as Carson went down the
three leaped forward, carrying the fight back into
the street.</p>

<p>Ironton went reeling away, clasping his stomach
where Billy’s fist had located his solar plexus.
Clancy floored Murray, while Chip sent another
of the assailants staggering. How the battle
would have ended was doubtful, had not Bully<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
Carson scrambled to his feet at this juncture and
promptly started for home.</p>

<p>Already demoralized by their failure to carry
the three friends off their feet at the first rush,
the Clippers lost any further desire for combat
on seeing their leader streaking his way into the
darkness.</p>

<p>Hardly had his flying figure disappeared when
the others broke. They attempted no retaliation
for the blows they had received, but simply melted
off into the night and vanished. Billy McQuade
would have pursued, but Chip seized his arm
and dragged him back.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” he panted, with a laugh. “We can
be mighty glad they’ve decided to go, Billy. No
use getting after them, or they might change their
minds.”</p>

<p>“Bring ’em on!” cried Clancy vigorously.
“Hoop-a-la! I’m just getting ready to scrap,
Chip!”</p>

<p>“Who were they?” asked Frank, getting Billy
calmed down. “Was it Carson and the Clippers?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you recognize Bully’s voice? Sure it
was.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a job for the town constable, then,”
said Clan energetically. “Chip, if this wasn’t a
cowardly, no-account, low-down assault, then I’ll
eat my hat!”</p>

<p>“Eat this one instead,” laughed Frank. He<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
picked up a soft felt hat which lay on the ground
at his side.</p>

<p>Billy struck a match. The hat bore a violent
scarlet band, and on the sweatband inside were
stamped the letters “E. T. C.”</p>

<p>“Who does that stand for?” asked Chip.</p>

<p>“Bully Carson,” spoke up Billy promptly.
“Edward T., otherwise Bully. Say, fellows, I
guess we can land that bunch in the lockup, hey?
There must ’a’ been six or eight of ’em, and with
this for evidence we can maybe jail the whole
bunch.”</p>

<p>“Seemed to be more like a dozen,” said Clancy.</p>

<p>Merry laughed.</p>

<p>“Come along, you two fire eaters. Billy’s right,
for I counted six.”</p>

<p>“You were cooler than I was, then,” commented
Clancy. “Shall we go wake up the constable,
old man? There’s no doubt about our
being able to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>“I think they’ve had enough punishment, to
judge by the way they acted. Let it go, fellows.
You aren’t hurt?”</p>

<p>“Nary scratch,” said Clancy. “Somebody hit
me with a brick, but it struck my shoulder and
didn’t hurt. Of course, if you think it’s better
not to prosecute ’em, I’m agreeable. But I’d like
to see that cuss Carson do time for this business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>Frank nodded. He knew exactly how his
chum felt in the matter, but the Clippers had received
fair punishment, and their attack had
failed. When he went on to state that by prosecuting
Carson they would be detained in town,
the others agreed instantly.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Billy. “We couldn’t afford to
miss that Franklin game. I wish you two obstinate
mules wouldn’t go to the hotel, though.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let your mother get a little sleep,” said
Clancy. “She got a bang-up supper after the
game, and it wouldn’t be fair to impose on her,
Billy. I’ll take you back to-morrow in the
<em>Hornet</em>, if you’ll sit on the running board.”</p>

<p>“You bet I will! Just the same, I wish we
were goin’ back to-night,” added Billy, with a
worried note in his voice. “The Carsons are
down on you because you helped me, Chip, and
they never overlook an injury.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Bully will overlook anything for
a day or two,” said Frank. “I landed on his right
eye twice, anyhow. Nonsense, Billy! He’s tried
for a cowardly revenge and he’s failed, and that
closes up the incident. We’ll get back to Fardale
to-morrow night if your mother doesn’t kill us
with that chicken dinner she promised for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yum!” and Clancy smacked his lips. “Billy,
don’t say anything more about our going back
to-night, or I’ll assassinate you! Wow! Your<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
mother’s chicken dinners certainly do hit me in
the right spot!”</p>

<p>“All right,” retorted Billy Mac. “But I’d bet
you fifteen thousand dollars and a half that we
hear from that crowd again!”</p>

<p>Merry flung the initialed hat into the street,
and they went on their way. None of the three
observed a shadowy form that followed them at
a little distance, as if spying on their movements.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FATHER AND SON.</span></h2>


<p>Bully Carson, long after midnight, was still
sitting over a washbowl in his room at home,
bathing a startlingly black eye. It was a painful
operation.</p>

<p>He was growling savagely to himself as he
worked. There was a strong smell of arnica in
the air, while his room was decorated with cigarette
stubs and hastily discarded garments. These
latter were calculated to be striking in appearance,
and they were. When attired in all his
glory, Bully Carson, as Billy Mac said, could be
heard coming a full mile away.</p>

<p>Just at present he was attired only in his underwear,
however, and in several bruises. He
had been adorning these with arnica, but not with
arnica alone, for ranged beside him were all manner
of bottles.</p>

<p>At intervals of five minutes, Bully would
anxiously pick up a hand mirror and examine his
injured eye. It was something of a job, since
he could only see out of the other one, and he
gained little joy from it.</p>

<p>“He must ’a’ hit me with a brick!” he muttered
vengefully. His mutter mingled with a groan of
despair as he took another look at his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>“Wow! I guess I’ll get my auto and get out o’
town fer a while&mdash;this is only gettin’ worse every
minute! Yes, sir, that’s what I’ll do, as soon’s
Ironton shows up. He’s watchin’ them fellers,
and if they get the constable I reckon I’ll have
passengers in that car o’ mine.”</p>

<p>Bully Carson was disheartened, there was no
doubt of that. He was also discolored, and
realized the fact thoroughly. He had counted on
flashing a particularly flamboyant necktie on the
girls the next day, but the colors would not harmonize
very well with his eye. And his eye was
immense, and growing more so. Bathing only
seemed to help it along.</p>

<p>He began to dress. Late as the hour was, he
was determined to get his car and slink out of
town, rather than display his facial adornments to
Carsonville’s admiring gaze. He realized just
how admiring that gaze would be.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused, at the sound of some one
entering the house. He started, then recognized
his father’s step ascending the stairs. This was
strange, for when Colonel Carson had left for
Fardale he had expected to remain over Monday.
A moment later the colonel opened the door of his
son’s room and stepped in.</p>

<p>“Still up, eh?” he said. Then his eyes took
in the array of bottles, and he sniffed. “Arnica?”</p>

<p>“Arnica,” repeated Bully sullenly, keeping his
back to the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>“What have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“I been sittin’ on the roof eating scrambled
eggs&mdash;what’d you suppose?”</p>

<p>Being used to Bully’s disrespectful manner,
Colonel Carson took no notice.</p>

<p>“When I left, you agreed that you would get
Merriwell laid out,” he said. “Did you succeed?”</p>

<p>“If I had, I wouldn’t be packin’ up,” returned
Bully. He moved around until the light struck
his face. “See that peeper? Well, I’m goin’ to
take that car o’ mine and beat it. I’ll be back
in a few days.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, son, hold on,” but Colonel Carson
could not help smiling, angry though he was.
“Do you mean to say that kid licked you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t look that way, does it? He had about
a dozen fellers hid in a doorway, and they jumped
us with clubs. We couldn’t do nothin’.”</p>

<p>Bully reeled off this astonishing lie with assurance.
His father examined the black eye with
commiseration and rage.</p>

<p>“My poor boy! We’ll make that fellow rue
the day he ever came to Carsonville, son! So
you were going away, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I reckon I’ll lay over in Orton fer a
few days.”</p>

<p>Orton was a small town fifteen miles from
Carsonville, a mere country village, where it
would be easy to remain and pass over the injury<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
with any excuse. Colonel Carson nodded
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad, son. I dunno’s it won’t fit
in pretty well, too.”</p>

<p>Bully looked up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Thought you was goin’ to stay over in Fardale?
You must ’a’ done some tall hustling to get
back on that late train! Did you see Randall?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and Colonel Carson’s hard face darkened
suddenly. “He’s no good the way we
thought, Bully. He won’t throw the game.”</p>

<p>“Huh? Why not?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get down to reasons&mdash;didn’t have to.
He’s one o’ these here goody-goody fellows who
believe in sport for sport’s sake, prob’ly. Anyway,
he shied when I mentioned it, so I changed
my plans around a bit.”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder!” and Bully chuckled suddenly,
in unholy admiration. “You got the slickest
brain I ever did see! What’s the idea now?”</p>

<p>“Well,” and Colonel Carson sank wearily into
a chair, “you know that I want to get down some
bets on this Fardale-Franklin game, Bully. The
only thing is how to know which team will win,
d’you see?”</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;even with this eye,” said Bully, with
a grin. “Go on.”</p>

<p>“The Franklin pitcher is a wonder, but they
don’t know it at Fardale. Randall thinks he can
win easily, if he pitches. And he’ll pitch if Merriwell<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
doesn’t show up, that’s certain. So if Randall
pitches, it’s a dead sure thing that Franklin
wins the game.”</p>

<p>“And if Merriwell pitches&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then it’s not so sure. But listen here, Bully!
Randall put me wise to something, something
that made me alter my plans. We want to get
back at Merriwell, at both of ’em, father and son.
The father will get hit if Fardale loses, and the
kid gets hit if he don’t pitch.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“’Cause whoever pitches that game gets ’lected
captain o’ the Fardale team. I don’t understand
it all, but that’s how she lays. If Randall pitches,
Merriwell loses out all around, d’you see?”</p>

<p>“And if he pitched, then he’d get the ’lection?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Bully.”</p>

<p>The son grimaced, as he knotted a yellow-purple
necktie about his neck.</p>

<p>“Then he can pitch, fer all o’ me. By thunder,
I know when I got enough, pop. If you can figger
out any way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on, son, hold on!” and Colonel Carson
tugged at his goatee, smiling craftily. “You ain’t
never seen the old man lose out very long, have
you? He ain’t a-goin’ to this time, either. Merriwell
ain’t goin’ to pitch that game, see?”</p>

<p>“How you goin’ to keep him out?”</p>

<p>“That depends. Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“Gettin’ the constable to arrest me, mebbe,”<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
returned Bully easily. “I lost my hat, and he
slung it away after seein’ whose it was. Ironton
is watchin’ to see where he goes fer the night.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can take care of him easily enough,”
announced Colonel Carson, with great complacence.
“Your goin’ to Orton will come in
jest right, too.”</p>

<p>“Me? Not on your life!” exclaimed Bully fervently.
“You don’t get me mixed in no more
doings with that kid, Merriwell, pop. Not much!
I’m done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no you’re not!” said the other easily. “I’ll
get over to Fardale for that game, and I’ll get a
good bunch o’ money down on Franklin. That
cussed fool Merriwell done me out o’ the McQuade
mortgage, and I’m goin’ to make him and
his kid sweat for it, you bet!”</p>

<p>“I guess he wasn’t so much of a fool if he did
you out o’ anything,” muttered Bully, under his
breath.</p>

<p>“Yep, it’s a good scheme, a mighty good
scheme,” mused his father reflectively. “I’ll give
you a rake-off on them bets, Bully. Ain’t the kid
got an uncle named Dick Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Sure. What’s the idea?”</p>

<p>Bully began to take a keener interest in the
subject. He knew that the wily Colonel Carson
was rarely bested at such an encounter as this,
and hope sprang anew that his father could succeed
where he himself had failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>“You wait, son. I ain’t got the precise details
figgered out, but they’re a-comin’. Yes, they’re
on the way, all right.”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson fell to tugging thoughtfully at
his goatee. An instant later there came a soft
whistle below the windows.</p>

<p>“There’s Ironton now,” exclaimed Bully.</p>

<p>He crossed to the nearest window, and flung
up the sash.</p>

<p>“That you, Bully?” came the voice of Ironton.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s me. What’d you find out?”</p>

<p>There was a trace of anxiety in his tones. He
still half feared that Merriwell would arrest him
for that night’s work.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bully. I heard ’em talking.
They ain’t goin’ to do nothin’ about it, but figure
on goin’ home to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Ask where Merriwell is,” spoke up Colonel
Carson hastily. Bully repeated the question.</p>

<p>“He and the red-headed guy went up to the
Morton House,” answered Ironton. “How’s the
eye?”</p>

<p>“Black,” said Bully, with a curse. “I’m goin’
to skip out o’ town fer a few days. Much obliged,
Ironton. See you later.”</p>

<p>He closed the window. Colonel Carson had
risen, and was reflectively fingering a telegraph
blank he had extracted from his pocket.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to get that information, Bully. I<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
guess I can fix Mr. Chip Merriwell without much
trouble!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how,” growled Bully.</p>

<p>“You will, as soon as you get your car out. I
want you to do an errand over at Orton, and I
guess there won’t be any chance to go wrong this
time. Get ready, and when the car’s out come to
my room.”</p>

<p>And Colonel Carson made his exit, whistling
softly to himself.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LURED AWAY.</span></h2>


<p>“No use&mdash;I can’t sleep a morning like this!”</p>

<p>Chip Merriwell jumped out of bed and went
to the window. It was early Sunday morning,
and from the room at the hotel which he and
Clancy occupied he had a clear view of the village
green, the streets leading on down toward
the river, and the green opposite slope of the
valley beyond.</p>

<p>The air was heavy with apple blossoms, warm
with spring richness, and Frank drank it in
eagerly. From somewhere about the place he
heard the pur of a motor car, but could see
nothing of the machine.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I can stay indoors,” he sighed
softly, and turned to where his clothes lay on a
chair.</p>

<p>Indeed, the morning was a perfect one. The
little town lay still, deserted, apparently empty
of all life. Yet its streets were clothed with
freshness, and its feathery-leaved trees were
green with new spring life. From the fruit
orchards that hedged Carsonville there drifted
renewed sweetness on every breeze.</p>

<p>Chip glanced at his chum, but Clancy was
sleeping the sleep of the just. The red-haired<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
chap put in his daytime most energetically, and
when he slept he did it with just as much vigor.</p>

<p>“I’ll let him pound his ear,” smiled Chip, as he
flung on his clothes, impatient to be outdoors.
“Anyway, I’d just as soon have a walk all by
myself for a change. I’ve a good notion to go
down and take a dip in the mill pond, by gracious!”</p>

<p>At thought of the cool, inviting waters of the
river, which he had explored with the aid of
Billy Mac, he finished his dressing hurriedly. The
hotel was still dead to the world, and Frank
quietly let himself out into the silent corridor.</p>

<p>Downstairs, however, he found the clerk
sweeping out the office. The clerk looked up with
a cheery greeting and a wide grin, for Chip was
already a popular hero in Carsonville, after the
game of the day before.</p>

<p>“Up early, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Too fine a morning to sleep,” said Chip.
“What’s that machine I heard buzzing around?”</p>

<p>“The garage is down the street a ways,” explained
the clerk, leaning on his broom. “They’ve
got one machine there for hire. Want to get it?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” and Frank laughed. “I was
only mildly curious. Clancy’s car is all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I seen it out in the back yard only just
now.”</p>

<p>Merry nodded and passed on to the veranda.
At sight of the upturned chairs he was attacked<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
by sudden laziness, and with a yawn turned over
one of the chairs and seated himself, drinking
in the clear air greedily.</p>

<p>“Mornings like this make life worth living,”
he reflected contentedly. “I’ll wager that if folks
knew how good these early spring mornings were,
they’d go to bed earlier and get up earlier. It’s
worth all the rest of the day!”</p>

<p>He sprawled out comfortably. He was still
weary with his stiff game of the previous afternoon,
and his long evening following, and soon
realized that if he sat here very long he would
be fast asleep once more. So, after five minutes,
he forced himself to rise.</p>

<p>“I never thought I’d be getting lazy!” he murmured.
“Well, down to the river and have a
quick dip, then a rest on the long grass, and back
to rout Clan out in time for breakfast.”</p>

<p>He paused as he reached the steps, for he
caught sight of a solitary figure that seemed to be
approaching the Morton House.</p>

<p>The figure was that of a farmer, but this signified
nothing in Carsonville, where every one
owned farms or orchards, or else worked in them.
The man was tall, round-shouldered, and his face
was decorated with a yellowish wisp of beard.
He seemed to be a powerful fellow, Chip thought.</p>

<p>As he approached the hotel, Merry caught sight
of the man’s face. It was not exactly a pleasant
one, for the eyes were very close set, and<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
there was a general look of shrewd cunning about
the man which was not reassuring.</p>

<p>Frank would not have noticed him, had the
man not been inspecting him rather closely as he
drew near. It occurred to Merry that the fellow
might be looking for him.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” he exclaimed. “This is certainly
great spring weather, eh?”</p>

<p>“Purty good,” and the man looked him over
curiously. “Say, mister, mebbe you kin tell me
if there’s a feller at the hotel by the name o’ Merriwell?
Frank Merriwell, I guess the front part
of it is.”</p>

<p>Merry wondered. Without any undue self-glorification,
he thought it odd that the man did
not know him, for every soul in town had witnessed
the game of the previous day. He himself
had come in for a good deal of attention.</p>

<p>“I believe he’s stopping here,” he said. “In
fact, you happen to be talking to him at this moment.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, now!” The man stared up. “Are you
him?”</p>

<p>“I’m it,” laughed Frank. “Anything I can do
for you?”</p>

<p>“Why, I was down to the railroad dee-po jest
now, when a tellygram come in fer a feller o’ that
name. The agent, he couldn’t come up very well,
so I said I’d fetch it along and see if you was
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>While he spoke, the man began fishing in the
pocket of his overalls, and at last pulled out a
yellow envelope. Merry took it with a nod. He
knew that there was no regular telegraph office
in the little town, messages being handled from
the railroad station, so he thought little of the
matter.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m much obliged to you for your trouble,”
he said, taking out a quarter as the man
handed him the message. “If you’ll take&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, mister,” and the man turned away
without taking the money. “I couldn’t take
nothin’, thanks. So long.”</p>

<p>“So long,” said Frank.</p>

<p>He tore open the message, as the man slouched
away down the street. It was a typewritten message,
and had evidently been received at Carsonville
some ten minutes previously.</p>

<p>“By gracious!” he said. “What the deuce has
struck Uncle Dick, anyhow? And where or what
is Orton?”</p>

<p>This was the message that caused him so much
wonder:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Frank Merriwell, Junior</span>, Carsonville: Have your
father meet me not later than nine, Sunday morning, Orton.
Very important. Keep destination secret.</p>

<p class="center p-1 shiftright"><span class="smcap">Uncle Dick.</span></p></div>

<p>Merry stared down at it, frowning. There
must be a place named Orton, though he knew<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
of none in the vicinity. But what was Dick Merriwell
doing there?</p>

<p>He turned at a step, to find the clerk sweeping
out the refuse through the doorway of the hotel.
Chip knew that he would be able to get information
at once, and spoke.</p>

<p>“Where is Orton? Is that any place near
here?”</p>

<p>“Orton? Sure, Mr. Merriwell!” The clerk
jerked his thumb over across the valley. “It ain’t
what you might call a metropolis, nohow, but it’s
got a smithy and a couple o’ stores and a schoolhouse.
Thinkin’ o’ goin’ over there?”</p>

<p>Frank started. Going over there! Why, of
course!</p>

<p>“How far is it from here?” he queried.</p>

<p>“About fifteen mile by road, I take it. ’Bout
ten, as the crow flies.”</p>

<p>While the clerk paused to stare at him curiously,
Merry considered. If his uncle was at
Orton, he must be expecting his father to meet
him there. But Frank Merriwell, senior, had returned
home on the late train! And Dick had
stated that it was very important, so there was
but one thing to do.</p>

<p>“Clan hasn’t waked up yet,” thought Chip, “so
I guess I won’t disturb him. I’ll go down and
see if I can get that garage machine, and if it’s
taken then I can rouse up Clancy and get the
<em>Hornet</em> buzzing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>He turned to the clerk, with quick decision,
shoving the telegram into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Yes, I just received a telegram&mdash;&mdash;” he
stopped, remembering the admonition in that
telegram. “But, by the way, I’d rather you
wouldn’t say anything to any one about my going
to Orton, will you?”</p>

<p>“Sure not,” assented the clerk at once.</p>

<p>“Tell Clancy that I’ll be back before noon,”
went on Merry, turning. “I’ll get a car if I can,
and be back by then, easily. Much obliged to
you!”</p>

<p>“You got a good morning for the trip,” called
the clerk after him. “Good luck!”</p>

<p>Chip waved his hand in return, and walked
down the street toward the garage. He glanced
about for the messenger, but doubtless the man
had returned to the station, and he sighed.</p>

<p>“I see where I don’t get that early swim this
morning! Well, that’s what comes of a fellow
having a family!”</p>

<p>And with a whimsical grimace he saw the
garage ahead of him. In front was an old-fashioned
but comfortable-looking car, with a young
fellow busily engaged in washing it off.</p>

<p>“Must be expecting Sunday traffic,” thought
Frank. “That looks a whole lot better than
Clan’s bumpy old scrap heap, just the same. Six-cylinder,
too, so probably she can go some.”</p>

<p>Approaching the washer, he inquired if the car<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
was for rent. The young fellow hailed the proprietor
of the garage, inside, and the latter came
out and nodded to Chip at once.</p>

<p>“You’re young Merriwell, ain’t you? I seen
that game yesterday, by thunder! Is it you who
wants to get a car?”</p>

<p>“I want to go over to Orton and back,” said
Merry, “if your car’s for rent.”</p>

<p>“For rent? To you?” A wide grin came
over the man’s face. “Say, Merriwell, you
couldn’t rent no car off’n me, not if you was to
offer me a cold million dollars!”</p>

<p>“Eh!” Merry looked at him in astonishment.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Anybody that lays over Colonel Carson like
you did yesterday, son, can have my car when
he wants it, see? No, don’t do any hollering. I
won’t take no pay, except for gas and the chauffeur.
Just expenses. You’ll have to get back
by noon, though. I only got the one car, and
it’s engaged for the afternoon.”</p>

<p>Finding that the man was absolutely earnest
in his refusal to take money, Chip assented.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back as soon as we can reach Orton
and turn around,” he said, getting into the car.
“And I’m much obliged to you, sir!”</p>

<p>“Pleasure’s all mine, son,” returned the other,
with a grand air.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHERE IS MERRY?</span></h2>


<p>“Great morning, Chip!”</p>

<p>Clancy was drowsily looking out of the window.
His eyes had just opened, and he had not
yet observed the absence of his chum.</p>

<p>“Wake up and take a look at things, you
lazy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Clan turned over to give Merry a punch, then
suddenly sat up.</p>

<p>“Well, by Jupiter!” he gasped.</p>

<p>He noticed for the first time that his chum’s
clothes had disappeared, as well as Chip himself.
Then he turned toward the window, hearing a
church bell ringing sweetly across the valley, and
noticed the maturity of the morning.</p>

<p>“Jumping whippoorwills! I must have overslept
a whole lot&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that moment there came a sudden, furious
knocking on the door. Clancy paused, half out
of bed, and poised a pillow to fling as the door
opened.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he yelled. “I’m not deaf. Come
in, you imitation of a real man! You don’t fool
me, Chip Merriwell&mdash;&mdash;Wow! Get out o’
here!”</p>

<p>Clancy had thought that it was his chum, but<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
as the door opened wide his voice shot up to a
shrill yell. For there, looking in with rolling
eyes, was one of the two negresses who acted
as waitresses and bell boys at the hotel.</p>

<p>“Get out o’ here!” shrilled Clan, pulling the
bedclothes around him. “Can’t you hear? Shut
that door! What d’you think I am, a moving-picture
show?”</p>

<p>The door shut. From the outside came the
voice of the startled negress:</p>

<p>“Ah thought yo’ said to come in, suh. Ah
suttinly did!”</p>

<p>“I was wrong,” retorted Clancy, grinning in
spite of himself. “I meant to say go climb up
the flagpole and kill flies. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Why, suh, dar’s a gem’man downsta’rs askin’
foh yo’ an Mistuh Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name, and what time is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s dat ar McQuade boy. It’s ten o’clock,
suh.”</p>

<p>“Send him up,” and Clancy leaped for his
clothes. “Great Scott! Ten o’clock! Say, there
must be something in this Carsonville air! I
haven’t slept as late as this for a month of Sundays.”</p>

<p>He tore open his suit case, and went into
dressing with such furious energy that the room
was filled with baseball uniforms and sections of
underwear and clean shirts when Billy flung
open the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“What’s goin’ on here?” demanded the astonished
Billy Mac.</p>

<p>“Me, mostly,” said Clancy. “Where’s Chip?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? Say, are you just getting
up?”</p>

<p>“No!” roared Clancy, half into a clean shirt.
“I’m sitting on Brooklyn Bridge making mince
pie, you bonehead!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let me disturb you,” said Billy sarcastically.
“If you haven’t got your beauty
sleep, old sorrel top, go right back to bed. It’s
only ten o’clock, and I thought maybe you’d like
to take a sunrise swim down in the mill pond.”</p>

<p>Clancy cut these remarks short by seizing a
pillow and letting fly. Billy was sent back into
the corner, and came up grinning.</p>

<p>“Where’s Chip?”</p>

<p>“Look under the bed,” retorted Clancy. “I
just woke up. I suppose he’s dug out for the
river himself. There’s no sign of a bathroom
around this jay hotel.”</p>

<p>“What d’you expect for three dollars a week?
There, leave off that white shirt, Clan! We’ll go
down to the crick and meet Chip, then come back
here and dress.”</p>

<p>This program suited Clancy to perfection. On
their way down to the street, however, he
stopped and asked the clerk whether Chip had
left any message for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>“Sure, Mr. Clancy. Said he’d be back before
noon.”</p>

<p>“Huh? And when was that?”</p>

<p>“A little before seven this morning.”</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” cried Clancy. “Before seven!
Then Merry’s been gone for three hours, Billy!
He isn’t down at the river, you boob!”</p>

<p>“Quit calling names,” retorted Billy, a trace
of anxiety in his clear eyes. “It didn’t improve
your manners to go West, I reckon. Sure, we’ll
go down and see, anyhow. He might be asleep
in the sun down there.”</p>

<p>Clancy asked the clerk if he knew where Merry
had gone. The clerk, mindful of Chip’s injunction,
said that he “couldn’t say,” and the two
friends went off toward the river in helpless wonderment.</p>

<p>Billy said nothing, but he was not a little worried.
Clancy suspected nothing wrong, though
he knew that it was not Chip’s usual custom to
disappear without leaving any word of where he
had gone.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the mill pond they found no
sign of Merry. Clancy scoffed at the fears of
his friend, so they stripped and took a hasty dip,
then dressed and made their way back to the
hotel.</p>

<p>“If he don’t show up pretty soon,” said Billy,
“mother will be all balled up with her chicken
dinner, Clan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we aren’t going to wait for him,” said
Clancy firmly. “I want that chicken dinner, believe
me! We’ll give him half an hour, then
we’ll load into the <em>Hornet</em> and go up to your
house. Maybe he’s there now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. McQuade had been requested to prepare
an early dinner, as the three friends intended returning
to Fardale in the <em>Hornet</em> that afternoon.
So promptly at eleven-thirty Clancy got out his
car and ordered the reluctant Billy to climb in.
Since there was a strong possibility that Merriwell
was at the McQuade house, Billy finally
obeyed.</p>

<p>“Nothing could happen to him,” scoffed
Clancy, as they climbed the hill. “He’s off on a
walk, that’s all, and probably has gone to sleep on
the shady side of a tree.”</p>

<p>Mrs. McQuade had seen nothing of Merry,
and since her dinner was all ready and waiting,
she put aside a generous portion to keep warm
for Chip and insisted on Clancy and Billy pitching
in at once.</p>

<p>They did so, but as the meal progressed Clancy
began to feel the same anxiety that was worrying
his friend. Finally he asked Mrs. McQuade
to hold her pies in the oven for a little.</p>

<p>“Billy and I will run back to the hotel. He
might be there, or on the way.”</p>

<p>The two jumped into the <em>Hornet</em>, and Clancy
hit only the high spots until they drew up before<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
the hotel. A man came down the steps, and
Clancy recognized him as the garage proprietor.</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Clancy, where’s Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he here?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned the man, in a worried voice.
“I got that auto rented this afternoon, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Auto!” yelled Billy. “Did he rent your
auto?”</p>

<p>“Why, sure! Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, I didn’t!” snapped Clancy. He
wakened abruptly to the fact that there must be
something seriously wrong. “When was this?”</p>

<p>“About seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go to?”</p>

<p>The garage proprietor hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, last thing he says was not to say anything.
But mebbe you boys could go and see if
anything’s wrong. Anyhow, you’re his pals, so
I reckon he wouldn’t mind me tellin’ you so much.
He went over to Orton, or said he was goin’
there.”</p>

<p>“What the deuce was he going to Orton for?”
queried Billy, in astonishment. “Why, there’s
nothing there but a schoolhouse and a smithy!”</p>

<p>Clancy frowned. He looked to see the clerk
coming down toward them in a hesitant way,
having heard the conversation.</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothin’ wrong, is there?” inquired
the clerk.</p>

<p>“Seems to be,” and Clancy gave him a sharp<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
look. “Didn’t Merry say he was going to Orton?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know about it, then?” said the clerk,
looking relieved. “Why, yes, the telegram come
from Orton, I think he said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” sang out Billy.
“There’s no telegraph station at Orton, and you
know it! Did he tell you that?”</p>

<p>“Well, he got a telegram, then he started askin’
me about Orton,” returned the clerk. “I didn’t
ask no questions, so I don’t know where it come
from. He seemed rather fussed, though.”</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong, Clancy,” murmured
Billy, leaning over and speaking in a low
voice. “It isn’t like Chip to go off like that.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Clancy, “that’s not his regular
trail at all.”</p>

<p>He turned to the garage proprietor.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about the car, sir. We’ll do a
little inquiring around here, and then start out
after it. But whatever loss you incur will be
made good.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give a whoop,” explained the man,
“only I’d promised the car for this afternoon
to another party. Far’s I’m concerned, Merriwell
could have the car out all day without payin’
a cent. But I hate to disappoint folks.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see what can be done,” said
Clancy. “How far to this place?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen miles or less. The roads ain’t none<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
too good, but it ain’t a long ride at all. The car
was in good shape, too.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” grunted Clan. “Mighty funny if it’d
take a car five hours for that! But he might
have had a breakdown somewhere. It’d be a
good play to run out and take a look at Orton,
Billy.”</p>

<p>“Better look at that telegram first, Clan.”</p>

<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because we might learn something.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the office here?”</p>

<p>“At the depot. But I’d bet you thirteen thousand
dollars and fifty cents that we’ll find there
hasn’t been any message for Chip received.”</p>

<p>“Say, what’s got into you?” queried Clancy.
“Too much chicken pie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know same’s I do, only you won’t
say it,” sniffed Billy forebodingly. “It’s foul
play, Clan. Merry has helped me, and those
Carsons are getting even with him, that’s what
it is!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m beginning to think so myself, all
right,” said Clan soberly. “Only I didn’t want
to scare you out.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">INVESTIGATING.</span></h2>


<p>Once more assuring the garage proprietor that
any losses he might incur would be made good,
Clancy opened up the <em>Hornet</em> and started for the
railroad station.</p>

<p>“Colonel Carson owns a lot of land over
toward Orton,” stated Billy gloomily. “He’s
mixed up in this somewhere, you can believe
me!”</p>

<p>Clancy grunted, but made no reply. When they
reached the railroad station they had no difficulty
in finding the combination agent and telegraph
operator.</p>

<p>“Morning, Mr. Martin!” sang out Billy. “Did
you get a wire for Mr. Merriwell about seven
this morning?”</p>

<p>“Not me, Billy,” returned the agent. “Was he
expecting one?”</p>

<p>“Not that we know of, but he got one,” exclaimed
Clancy. “Are you sure that none came
in this morning or last night?”</p>

<p>“Nobody here last night, and nothing has come
this morning.”</p>

<p>The operator regarded them with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Did you say Merriwell got a telegram, Billy?”
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>“No, I said so,” snapped Clancy. “He certainly
got a telegram this morning, and if it
didn’t come through you, it’s a mighty queer
thing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I reckon it is,” returned the agent
calmly. This merely exasperated the red-headed
chap.</p>

<p>“Well it’s a darned funny thing,” he exclaimed,
“that telegrams can be received here without the
telegraph operator knowing it!”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no message come this morning,” declared
the agent again, and with a nod to Billy,
he turned and went back into his place of business.</p>

<p>For a moment the two friends were at a loss
what to do. It was quite evident that Chip Merriwell
had been called away to Orton by some
important affair, yet this agent declared that no
message had arrived for him!</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll go back and grill those fellows
over again,” said Clancy, starting the <em>Hornet</em>.
“We want to make sure about this telegram business.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to send a fake message,” suggested
Billy Mac.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see, then.”</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel, they questioned the
clerk anew. By this time he was in enough
anxiety to speak out fully, and stated emphatically<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
that he had seen the telegram, and that
Merriwell had mentioned it.</p>

<p>“I guess that settles it, Clan,” exclaimed Billy,
with a gloomy countenance. “He got a message,
all right, but it didn’t come through the station
agent.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that Colonel Carson or his
son had a hand in it?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do! Only, what’s their reason? Do
you think they tried to get Merry where they
could beat him up?”</p>

<p>“From what I saw of the colonel,” said Clancy
thoughtfully, “he wouldn’t go into anything so
raw as that, old man. Bully tried it and got all
that was coming to him last night. Granted that
Chip was lured away, there are some folks who
would have a decidedly good reason to keep him
out of sight for a day or two.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Some of the Franklin Academy crowd. I
may be doing him an injustice, but I’d be more
apt to blame Bob Randall than the Carsons,
Billy.”</p>

<p>Billy Mac stared in open disbelief.</p>

<p>“Randall? But why should he try to keep
Chip away from Fardale?”</p>

<p>“Because he wants to pitch in Monday’s game
against Franklin. It looks to me as if Randall
was trying for the place Ted Crockett will leave<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
vacant. If he won the Franklin game he’d be a
popular hero&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cut out this foolishness, Clan!”</p>

<p>Billy Mac leaned forward earnestly. He was
a staunch friend of Merriwell’s, but he had seen
Bob Randall at his best, and both liked and admired
the fiery, handsome Southerner.</p>

<p>“You’re away off. Bob Randall isn’t that sort,
not by a good deal. He doesn’t like Chip particularly,
but it’s an honorable, open-faced dislike,
and it won’t last. If he knew anything like
this was going on, he would be the first one to
warn Chip. No, if there’s any one to blame,
Clancy, it’s the Carsons.”</p>

<p>The red-haired chap nodded. He was quick
to recognize that his words might have been an
injustice to Randall, whom he did not know at
all well. Moreover, if anything was wrong it
was no doubt inspired by Bully Carson or his
father.</p>

<p>“Yes, Billy, I got a bit out of perspective there,
I reckon. Randall or the Franklin crowd
wouldn’t be down here. Well, our best plan will
be to hit for Orton and see if Merry’s car got disabled.”</p>

<p>By dint of inquiries they soon found that there
was but one road to Orton, and that if they took
it there was no chance that they could miss
Merry. Clancy was for going to call on Colonel
Carson and putting it up to him straight, but<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
Billy Mac persuaded him to adopt the more sensible
course of taking the road to Orton and tracing
up Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up to your house, then,” said Clancy,
“and load up with some rations. Chip may be
pretty hungry when we find him, and there’s no
knowing how long we’ll be gone. Besides, we’d
better tell your mother nothing of what we
suspect. No use worrying her, Billy.”</p>

<p>This was sound argument, and when they arrived
at the McQuade home they said nothing of
their uneasiness. Clancy stated that Chip had
been called over to Orton very unexpectedly, and
that they were going over to meet him, and might
possibly proceed on to Fardale without returning.</p>

<p>So, loading the <em>Hornet</em> with their belongings
and a generous amount of Mrs. McQuade’s toothsome
edibles, the two started out on the trail of
Frank Merriwell, junior. Once outside of town,
Clancy opened up the <em>Hornet</em> and showed what
she could do.</p>

<p>“I took her off the scrap heap,” he declared
proudly, “and while she doesn’t look up to much,
she can certainly go some!”</p>

<p>Billy’s interest was only perfunctory, however.
He was still thinking about Chip and the Carson
family.</p>

<p>“Funny we didn’t see Bully around town, Clan.
He usually sports around in his gay duds on<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
Sunday, and runs an old car he bought second-hand.
The colonel sticks to horses, but Bully
likes to make an impression with his car.”</p>

<p>“I guess Merry gave him a black eye last
night,” said Clancy. “That may account for his
failure to sport around. I guess the whole crowd
is laying low and keeping quiet for the present.”</p>

<p>Billy grunted, but relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>The Orton road was a rough one, and after
the first mile Clancy had to slow down a bit.
They were going directly away from the railroad,
and as they proceeded without seeing any trace
of the garage car, they found that the country
lost its prosperous aspect, and became a good deal
rougher and wilder.</p>

<p>More than once they passed rocky farms that
had been abandoned years before, although the
flowering orchards around Carsonville had
proved that, with industry and skill, the country
could be made productive.</p>

<p>Mile after mile reeled off without any token
of their quarry, other than tracks of auto tires in
the road, which might have been left by any one
of a dozen machines. At length they topped a
rise and saw Orton itself, two miles farther on.
It was a miserably small place, and Clancy’s
heart sank.</p>

<p>“There’d be an elegant place to hold Merry
prisoner,” said Billy, pointing to a deserted farmhouse
that stood back from the road to one side.<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
It was the fifth place he had pointed out with
the same idea, and Clancy grunted.</p>

<p>“You’re off, Billy. I don’t believe Merry was
ever in this jay town. There’s nothing to it but a
blacksmith shop and a couple of stores.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think that’s what’s happened?”
persisted Billy Mac.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. Chip may have been lured away,
all right, but Colonel Carson has too much gumption
to work that kind of a racket, according to
my notion. No hotel here, is there?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Billy anxiously. “We can find out
if Merry was here by going to the smithy. The
blacksmith lives just behind it.”</p>

<p>Orton was not even large enough to be possessed
of a church, it appeared. The little place
seemed absolutely desolate in the Sunday afternoon
quiet, but as the <em>Hornet</em> drew up in front
of the smithy, Clancy saw that the blacksmith
was standing under an apple tree, watching them.</p>

<p>Leaping out, the two hastened into the orchard
behind the smithy, and proceeded to question the
burly smith.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say,” he responded to their inquiries.
“I’ve seen two or three machines go
past, but didn’t pay much attention. Mebbe my
wife did. Hold on a minute.”</p>

<p>He turned and lifted a shout at the house in
the rear. A tired-looking woman came forth,
and made response that she had seen Bully Carson’s<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
machine early that morning, but had not
noticed the others.</p>

<p>“Bully Carson!” exclaimed Billy, in a low
voice. “We’re on the trail, Clancy!”</p>

<p>Clancy considered. If they were to make inquiries
through the place, it might be best to
leave the <em>Hornet</em> here. Turning to the smith, he
found that the latter sold gasoline to the few
cars coming through the place, and arranged to
leave the <em>Hornet</em> in his care.</p>

<p>Returning to the car, he brought it around behind
the smithy, and with Billy made his way to
the tree-bordered street. An instant later, Billy
clutched his arm.</p>

<p>“I hear a car, Clan! It’s coming this way!”</p>

<p>The two friends stopped, the slow exhaust of
a motor car coming clearly from ahead of them.
The car came into sight, running slowly toward
them. There was a single figure at the wheel.</p>

<p>“By gracious, it’s Bully!” cried McQuade excitedly.</p>

<p>The car rolled toward them at a slow pace.</p>

<p>“Get ready to jump her,” ordered Clancy, in a
tense voice.</p>

<p>“What you going to do?”</p>

<p>“We’ll do a little kidnaping on our own hook,
Billy. Watch out, now!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum">[186]</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE THIRD DEGREE.</span></h2>


<p>Carson was evidently quite unsuspecting. Possibly
he did not see the two figures that waited
at the roadside. At all events his car rolled
slowly past the smithy, and, as it came opposite
to their waiting place, Clancy nudged Billy and
leaped forth.</p>

<p>He believed in doing a thing thoroughly, when
he <em>was</em> doing it. Consequently, as he saw Bully
twist around in his seat with a start of alarm,
Clancy gave him no chance to increase his speed,
but put all his energies into a flying leap.</p>

<p>A cry broke from Carson, but he was too late.
Clancy rose in the air like a bird and struck full
against him, driving him down at once. The
two fell in a confused tangle under the steering
wheel, while the car went slowly along the road.</p>

<p>Meantime, Billy Mac jumped to the running
board and piled into the tonneau. He leaned over
the back of the front seat. Before he could
lend assistance, the two figures came erect, and
Clancy shoved Carson bodily over into the
tonneau.</p>

<p>“Keep him there, Mac,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“What you going to do?” gasped Billy.</p>

<p>“No time to talk,” said Clancy, jumping to the<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
steering wheel. “Throw a robe over that fellow’s
head! Sit on him, you chump!”</p>

<p>Carson, indeed, was rising to the occasion. He
had landed in the tonneau on his head and shoulders,
and was squirming upright, letting out wild
yells as he did so. The peace of the Sabbath was
being terribly shattered.</p>

<p>Billy Mac saved the day by adopting Clan’s
suggestion. Seizing the heavy blanket that did
duty for an auto robe, he threw it over Carson’s
head, managed to evade the waving fists, and
plumped himself on top of the big fellow.</p>

<p>Carson was forced to the floor of the car,
which had leaped into speed under Clancy’s
touch. Billy McQuade being a chunky fellow for
his age, made no light weight, and Carson’s bellows
for help were stifled.</p>

<p>So quickly had it all occurred, that, while Bully
Carson must have recognized his assailants, he
had been too startled to propound any questions.
In fact, he had been hustled about so rapidly that
when Billy came down on him he had no more
breath left with which to shout.</p>

<p>After a moment Clancy stopped the car on a
lonely stretch of road, and told Billy to shove
their prisoner out. Billy did not stand on ceremony,
but opened one of the side doors and sent
Carson tumbling out like a bag of flour.</p>

<p>The big fellow landed in the dust, came to his<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
feet, flung off the robe, and emerged, spluttering
with rage.</p>

<p>“What’s this mean!” he exclaimed hotly. “I’ll
have you dubs pinched fer this!”</p>

<p>Clancy grinned.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, Bully. You’re liable to get
pinched yourself for what took place last night.
Where’s Chip Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” demanded Carson, working
himself up into a rage. “You’d better clear
out, and do it quick, or I’ll smash your carrot
head in about&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No more of that talk,” said Clancy. “You’re
a coward, my friend. If you try fighting, you’ll
get the worst of it by a good deal. Where’s Chip
Merriwell?”</p>

<p>Clancy gave no sign of his inward perturbation.
He had conducted this assault absolutely
without evidence, and on a momentary impulse.
If he failed to extract any information, he was
apt to find himself up against the law.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anythin’ about him,” said Carson
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Don’t lie,” said Clancy angrily. “You sent
him a fake telegram that got him over to Orton
this morning. Where is he?”</p>

<p>Carson went white.</p>

<p>“How’d you know that&mdash;&mdash;” he began, then
checked himself and tried to bluster it off.<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
“You’re crazy, you boobs! I ain’t seen the feller&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You make me sick,” said Clancy, with renewed
self-confidence. “You gave yourself away
right there, Bully. Now come across, or take the
consequences.”</p>

<p>Carson glared at him out of his one good
optic.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you!” he bellowed. “You ain’t
a-goin’ to get clear with this kind o’ doin’s around
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And turning swiftly, he shoved Billy Mac
aside and made a break down the road. Clancy
grinned inwardly. Carson was not only scared,
but he was extremely anxious to get away.</p>

<p>Clancy caught the big fellow within fifty feet.
Carson showed fight, but the red-haired chap
decided to waste no further time. Catching the
arm of Carson, he twisted it behind the other’s
back, and had him at his mercy.</p>

<p>“Take his arm, Billy,” he commanded. “Put
him into the machine and keep him quiet. If he
yells for help, twist his arm and it’ll break just
below the elbow.”</p>

<p>Carson went green.</p>

<p>“Hey, what you fellers tryin’ to do?” he whimpered.
“Ouch! I’ll go along&mdash;don’t twist that
arm, Billy! We allus been friends, ain’t we?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” retorted Billy Mac, with unconcealed
contempt. “I always knew you were a<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
coward, Bully, but I thought you’d show a little
fight! Get along with you.”</p>

<p>Clancy climbed into the driver’s seat, feeling
highly satisfied with himself. He had forced a
practical admission from Carson that his suspicions
were correct, and he grimly made up his
mind to force a good deal more from the fellow.</p>

<p>“Where you goin’, Clan?” inquired Billy, with
some anxiety.</p>

<p>He had shoved Carson into the tonneau and
followed him, still grasping his arm.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Clancy, with a wink that Bully
did not catch, “I think we’d better take him to
that deserted house you pointed out, as we came
into town. Then we can torture him until he
confesses.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” grinned Billy. “We’ll do some fancy
branding on him, and if that don’t work, we can
hang him up by the thumbs and roast his feet,
eh?”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, perhaps, he overdid the matter.
Carson’s evil conscience had turned him into
an arrant coward, but it had not destroyed his
judgment by any means. He perceived that the
two were trying to frighten him, and he relapsed
into a sullen silence.</p>

<p>“You’d better tell us where Merry is,” stated
Clancy, turning to look into the heavy, surly
features. “I’ll warn you, Bully, that we’re not
inclined to show you any mercy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>“Go to thunder!” growled the captive, and followed
it with a string of curses. Clancy flushed
angrily and threw in the clutch.</p>

<p>“All right, my friend,” he grated. “You’ll get
yours!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they drew up at the deserted
house outside town. Clancy drove around to the
side, installed the machine in the half-ruined
barn, and reconnoitered the house. A door was
swinging on its hinges, but the place in general
was in tolerable condition. He returned to the
barn and took out his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Put his wrists together,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“Give him a chance to talk,” pleaded Billy.
Clancy nodded.</p>

<p>Carson, however, merely poured out a string
of curses and began to plunge in a furious attempt
to escape. His twisted arm soon made
him quiet.</p>

<p>“Take him up to the house,” said Clancy, when
he had been bound. “I’ll get some stuff to make
a fire with.”</p>

<p>Billy obeyed. He deposited Carson in an
empty room, tied his ankles securely, then returned
to Clancy with an anxious face.</p>

<p>“See here, Clan, how far are you goin’? You
don’t mean to torture him?”</p>

<p>“I should hope not,” said Clancy, with a grin.
“I feel like it, but I don’t believe I’d go that far.
I’m goin’ to walk back and get the <em>Hornet</em>. We’ll<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
have something to eat, and maybe you can scare
him into talking before I get back.”</p>

<p>Clancy’s hope was vain. When he returned
with the <em>Hornet</em> and their provisions, he found
that Carson had absolutely refused to say a word
on the subject. Billy was not a little anxious,
but Clancy stood firm.</p>

<p>“Billy, I’m goin’ to make that fellow talk if I
have to bust every law on earth. Just stop to
think&mdash;he’s done something to Chip, and knows
where he is. He seems to have a notion that
we’re throwing a bluff into him about torture
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So we are,” interjected Billy. “You know it
blamed well.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” admitted Clancy, with a grimace.
“But I’m goin’ to make him think he’s wrong, if I
can.”</p>

<p>There ensued a series of bluffs at torture on
Clancy’s part, but they had not the slightest effect
on Carson.</p>

<p>But Bully Carson stood pat. The first shock
of alarm over, he resisted all of Clancy’s efforts
with a grim silence that could not be broken. He
knew that he was helpless, but he also knew that
despite Clancy’s talk the red-haired chap would
not dare to proceed to extremities. And as long
as he could hold silence, he intended to do so.
Merriwell must be kept out of that Franklin
game. He knew that his father had gone to<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
Fardale and would doubtless plunge heavily on
the result of the game. Since money meant
more than anything else to the Carson family,
Bully intended making a hard fight of it.</p>

<p>He did so. Clancy and Billy built a roaring
fire in the old fireplace when darkness came on.
This took the damp from the main room of the
farmhouse, and rendered it habitable. They ate
some of their provisions, refusing to give Carson
anything to eat or drink. Finally Clancy
gave up in disgust.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said grimly to the prisoner.
“You’ll stay here a month if you don’t loosen up,
old scout. Billy, we’ll take turns keeping him
awake to-night. He must have been on the go
most of last night and to-day, and that’ll bring
him to terms.”</p>

<p>When morning dawned, Bully Carson was
haggard and drawn, but still refused to open his
lips. Clancy was desperate. Thirsty and hungry
though their captive was, nothing seemed to have
any effect. Yet their only hope of rescuing Chip
Merriwell lay in making him talk.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of this,” said Clancy, when
the morning was half gone. “Billy, we’re up
against it. Right or wrong, that fellow’s going
to talk.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to really torture him?”
asked the white-lipped Billy.</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">QUICK WORK.</span></h2>


<p>Carson was worn out with lack of sleep and
exhaustion. When Clancy dragged him to the
fireplace, took a burning brand from the fire, and
approached him, he let out one frightened yell.</p>

<p>The red-haired chap knew that he could not
carry out his bluff, but he held so desperate a
countenance that Carson was overborne. Even
Billy himself half thought that Clancy meant to
put his bluff into effect.</p>

<p>“I give in!” yelled Carson wildly.</p>

<p>Clancy drew a long breath of relief, but did
not let Carson see it.</p>

<p>“Where’s Chip Merriwell?” he demanded
grimly.</p>

<p>“Don’t burn me!” yelled Carson frantically.
“Give me a drink!”</p>

<p>“You’ll drink when I get ready, and not before,”
roared Clancy. “Where’s Chip Merriwell?
Hurry up, you galoot!”</p>

<p>“He’s at the Brundage Farm, on the other side
of Orton,” gasped Bully. “For Heaven’s sake,
give me a drink!”</p>

<p>The bully had given in completely and absolutely.
None the less, he knew that since it was
getting on toward noon, all hope of getting to
Fardale for the game must now be over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>“Get up,” and Clancy kicked him to his feet.
“Billy, take him out to the car and you take the
wheel. I’ll come along in the <em>Hornet</em>. Make him
guide us to this Brundage place, and do it quick!”</p>

<p>“Give me a drink first,” pleaded Carson.</p>

<p>“You’ll drink when you get there, not before.
Jump lively!”</p>

<p>With a groan, Carson followed Billy. The fellow
was in a pitiable plight, but at thought of
Chip, Clancy lost all pity.</p>

<p>He soon ascertained from Billy Mac that
Brundage was a farmer living on one of the Carson
farms, just outside Orton, but on the opposite
side of the town from where they were at
present. Also, Carson loosened up with the
story.</p>

<p>He confessed to having lured Chip away, and
stated that both he and the driver of his machine
were being held at the farm in question, in order
that Chip should be detained from the Franklin
game. At this Clancy climbed into the <em>Hornet</em>
with a groan of despair.</p>

<p>“The harm’s done, now!” he reflected bitterly.
“Billy, Chip, and I will be out of the game for
certain. That means that Franklin will have a
walk-away, unless old Fardale comes up to the
scratch, or a miracle happens.”</p>

<p>Billy, driving Carson’s car with the owner
huddled in the tonneau, shot out on the road,
while Clancy followed in the <em>Hornet</em>. Poor Carson<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
was almost in a state of collapse, but Billy
allowed him no sleep.</p>

<p>The two cars shot through Orton like a streak,
giving Carson no chance to call for assistance.
On the other side of town they came in sight of
their goal&mdash;a large white farmhouse, set back
from the road.</p>

<p>Billy turned in at the drive and whizzed up to
the side of the house. As Clancy followed him,
two men appeared, one carrying a shotgun.
Clancy instantly perceived that their troubles had
just begun, and took charge of the situation.</p>

<p>“Get a drink of water for Mr. Carson,” he
cried, and the man with the shotgun leaned the
weapon against the side of the house and hurried
toward the well. The other came forward.</p>

<p>“This Mr. Brundage?” inquired Clancy.</p>

<p>“It is. What ye want? What’s the matter
with Bully?”</p>

<p>Clancy turned and drew a breath of relief at
sight of Bully, who had fallen sound asleep from
utter weariness.</p>

<p>“We came after Merriwell,” he stated, turning
to the farmer. “Get him out here in a hurry.
Bully is tired out, that’s all.”</p>

<p>This statement was perfectly true. At Clancy’s
air of haste, Brundage clawed his whiskers for
an instant, then turned and hurriedly stamped
into the house. Before the other man returned,<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
Clancy caught up the shotgun and thrust it into
Billy’s hands.</p>

<p>“Climb into the <em>Hornet</em> and be ready to light
out,” he exclaimed. “Keep that fellow covered.”</p>

<p>As the man approached, Billy ordered him to
put up his hands. Clancy was already examining
the barnyard. In one corner appeared an automobile,
which beyond a doubt was that of the
Carsonville garage.</p>

<p>The astonished farm hand obeyed Billy’s
abrupt order. Bully Carson was in no danger
of awakening for the present, and Clancy made
ready to depart as soon as Chip was produced.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to hit her up for Fardale, Billy.
When Chip comes, you give him that seat and
climb out to the running board&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Take Carson’s car,” suggested Billy.</p>

<p>“No. We’ll do it in the <em>Hornet</em>. That old bone
wagon of Bully’s couldn’t keep up with us for a
mile.”</p>

<p>At this moment Brundage appeared at the
door.</p>

<p>“Shall I let the other feller out&mdash;&mdash;” he began,
then stopped abruptly at sight of Billy covering
the farm hand with the shotgun. “Hey! What
you fellers up to?”</p>

<p>“You send Merriwell out here and do it in a
hurry,” said Clancy, striding toward the door.</p>

<p>“All right, Brundage!” sang out the farm<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
hand, with a grin. “I’ll ’tend to these fellers&mdash;that
old gun ain’t loaded!”</p>

<p>He started for Billy on the jump. Brundage
slammed the door and vanished.</p>

<p>At the man’s shout, Billy hastily examined the
shotgun. He found that it was unloaded, and
flung it to the ground. Clancy, flaming with anger
and despair, returned hastily to the machine
just as the farm hand leaped at Billy.</p>

<p>The red-haired chap was in no mood for argument.
His fist shot out and caught the farm
hand underneath the ear. The fellow gave a
grunt, then slumped weakly to the dust, and lay
quiet.</p>

<p>“We’re up against it, Clancy,” exclaimed Billy,
looking at the house. “He would have fallen for
it if he hadn’t seen me holding that chap up, or
trying to.”</p>

<p>“It’s all my fault,” said Clancy, with a groan.
“But we know that he’s got Merry in there, and
that’s some comfort. We’ll have to get him out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how&mdash;&mdash;” began Billy, but at that
instant he was interrupted.</p>

<p>A shrill yell arose from inside the house. Then
there followed a wild commotion.</p>

<p>Without warning, there was a crash of glass,
as a china plate came through one of the lower
windows. Another followed, and another, then
a chair burst through the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>“Wow! Lemme out o’ here!” came a shrill
yell. “I want to go home!”</p>

<p>Through the window protruded a frightened
countenance.</p>

<p>“It’s the garage driver from Carsonville!”
yelled Billy. “Come on, old scout!”</p>

<p>“Wow! Lemme out o’ here!”</p>

<p>It was evident that the young fellow was
scared almost out of his head. He took a flying
leap through the window and landed in a rose-bush.
In his hand he held two more plates, and
as he scrambled to his feet he hurled them against
the house.</p>

<p>Then, paying no attention to Clancy and Billy,
he rushed across the barnyard and cranked up
his machine. It was evident that he had broken
loose, and was too frightened to do anything but
hit it up for home.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” said Clancy. “We’ll get in that
window, Billy!”</p>

<p>He started for the house. The chauffeur, wild-eyed
and reckless, got his machine slewed around
and went shooting down the drive like a crazy
man.</p>

<p>“Wow!” he yelled, as he passed. “Git the constable!
Wow!”</p>

<p>Renewed sounds of commotion came from
within the house. Clancy dashed at the window.
Billy gave him a boost to the sill, and the red-haired<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
chap shot over the edge headfirst and
tumbled to the floor inside.</p>

<p>He found himself in a darkened room, evidently
the dining room of the farmhouse. It was
in wild confusion. Chairs were flung around,
the floor was littered with smashed crockery, and
over in the corner Clancy made out two figures
in furious combat.</p>

<p>As he rushed up, he saw that Chip Merriwell
was being gripped by the enraged Brundage, and
that the young athlete was fighting furiously for
his freedom, despite the handicap of handcuffs
on his wrists.</p>

<p>“Whoop-ee!” yelled Clancy, charging across
the room. “Here we are, pard!”</p>

<p>Merry managed to break loose, and, raising
his handcuffed wrists, he brought them down
across the brow of the farmer, who toppled forward.
Clancy caught his chum in his arms as
the man fell senseless.</p>

<p>“Come along, Chip&mdash;&mdash;” he cried, but Merry
broke in.</p>

<p>“Get the key for these irons, Clancy! He’s got
it in his vest pocket.”</p>

<p>Clancy leaned over, and, after a short search,
found the key of the handcuffs in the farmer’s
pocket. Straightening up, he inserted it in the
lock, and Merry’s hands fell free.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Clan! I thought you were
never coming!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll put these fellows over the road,” cried
Billy, who had also entered. “This will land the
Carsons in jail, all right.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’re all right,” said Merry. “They
got me over here on the pretext that Uncle Dick
was here. This man Brundage slipped the irons
on me, and they imprisoned me and the chauffeur.
Where’d he go?”</p>

<p>“Went home on the jump,” said Clancy.
“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Brundage came in and released him. Then
he went to the door a moment. The chauffeur
was almost wild with rage and fright, and he
started to smash his way out. I guess he did it,
all right!”</p>

<p>“Looks that way, Chip! Say, do you know
it’s ’most noon Monday? Let’s get out of this!”</p>

<p>The three hastily left by the window and ran
to the <em>Hornet</em>.</p>

<p>“We’re off for Fardale and the big game,”
cried Clancy exuberantly.</p>

<p>“You can’t get us there in time, can you?”
asked Merry anxiously.</p>

<p>“By thunder, I can try!” returned Clancy.
“Hang on, Billy! We’re off!”</p>

<p>And the <em>Hornet</em> darted away.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WON IN THE NINTH.</span></h2>


<p>Fardale field was clothed in gloom. The only
bright spot was the stand occupied by the
Franklin rooters, and they were certainly making
things lively in that quarter.</p>

<p>The great game was on, but as far as Fardale’s
chances were concerned, it seemed to be all
off. Inning after inning had run along, and time
after time Fardale had been saved from disgrace
only by mere good luck.</p>

<p>As it was, the eighth inning had started with
the score four to one in favor of Franklin. And
Peters, the Franklin pitcher, had tightened up
after the first inning, and was invincible.</p>

<p>Randall, pitching for Fardale, had started out
strong. In the fifth he had let in a run, and in
the sixth his poor support had sent him up in
the air. For Fardale had certainly put a poor
team in the field, with substitutes behind the bat,
on first, and in the pitcher’s box.</p>

<p>Even so, Randall might have held Franklin
had his own men been able to hit the swift curves
of Peters. Once he loosened up, however,
Franklin romped away with the game, and the
slaughter was on. All Fardale could now hope
for was to hold down the score, and she was
fighting desperately to that end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>Coach Trayne and Captain Ted Crockett were
talking anxiously together while the Fardale batters
were being mowed down in the final half of
the eighth.</p>

<p>“We’re gone completely now,” announced
Crockett gloomily. “We’ll get another chance
next inning, but the game’s over.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” said the coach, in perplexity.
“I’ve had no answers to any of my telegrams
from Chip or Billy or Clancy. At noon I
wired the hotel there, and they said that all three
had left yesterday. Nobody knows where they
are.”</p>

<p>“Something’s happened to ’em, all right,” said
Ted, as a storm of cheers swept out from the
Franklin bleachers, announcing that Peters had
fanned a second man. “Maybe that car of
Clancy’s has blown up. Did you wire Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“I’ve wired everybody in the country!” cried
the coach desperately. “Nobody knows anything
about it. Merry left Carsonville yesterday
morning, with Clan and Billy. That’s all.
They’ve dropped completely out of sight.”</p>

<p>“It’s a rotten shame,” muttered Crockett. “We
had to put Randall in, and they have simply murdered
him. The boys are all up in the air, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, hold the score down,” said Coach
Trayne, in desperation. “That’s all we can hope
for now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>Another roar went up from Franklin as Peters
fanned the third man. Villum Kess trotted out
to right field in gloomy fashion.</p>

<p>“Ve vos complexicated now,” he said, as
Crockett joined him. “Ve make a losings ven
Chip vos gone, yah! Ve vos our feet viped off
der earth of, Ted!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to hold ’em,” said the captain
glumly. “We get one more chance.”</p>

<p>Randall went into the pitcher’s box amid a
storm of cheers from the Fardale bleachers. The
Southerner realized that he had been outclassed,
but he was resolutely trying to hold his self-control.</p>

<p>“All right, Randall!” cried Crockett. “We’re
all with you, old man!”</p>

<p>“Yah, ve vos all mit you,” piped up Villum.
“But I vish dot Merry vos mit us, like plazes!”</p>

<p>As the first Franklin man came up, Fardale
redoubled its cheers. It was the first of the ninth.
If Franklin could be held to its four runs, there
was still a slim chance that Peters might be
pounded in the next half. But every one admitted
that the chance was too slim to be hoped for.
Peters had everything.</p>

<p>The batter fell on Randall’s first ball, and
cracked out a neat single. The next batter tried
for a sacrifice, but he was unable even to put
himself out. The ball rolled down to third, and
the third baseman made a wild throw to first.<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
Both men were safe, and the Franklin cheers redoubled.</p>

<p>It was too much for Randall. In his anger he
sent a fast one at the plate, and Peters himself
landed on it. The ball streaked down toward
first, but the unhappy substitute, playing Clancy’s
position, muffed it. By the time he got through
booting it around, the bases were filled, not a man
was out, and Franklin seemed fated to run up
a tremendous score.</p>

<p>The next man advanced to the plate with a
wide grin at Randall. The heavy end of Franklin’s
batting order was up. At this instant, however,
a shrill yell ascended from the gate.</p>

<p>“Merriwell! Merriwell! Stop the game!”</p>

<p>The yell rose to a roar. Men rose in the
bleachers, stamping and waving their hats.
Every one knew of Merriwell’s unexplained absence.
Randall went white, and would have delivered
the ball had not the umpire stopped him.</p>

<p>Across the field careered a dust-white <em>Hornet</em>,
with three uniformed figures clinging to it. Ted
Crockett turned with a wild yell as Clancy drew
up behind third.</p>

<p>“Get in the game!” he shouted. “Merry,
pitch! Take first, Clan! Catch, Billy!”</p>

<p>A renewed storm of yells swept the field as
the sudden shift of players was comprehended.
Randall, white-faced, tried to protest, but
Crockett waved him off the field. The three<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
friends had made shift to don their uniforms as
they rode into town, not without difficulty. Coming
through the village they had heard how the
game was going, and had hastened on to the
field.</p>

<p>While they took their positions, and Merry was
given a moment to warm up, the crowd fell silent.
Even the Franklin rooters had cheered, for they
were clean sportsmen, but the Fardale fans began
to realize that Merry had arrived too late.</p>

<p>“They can’t do anything now except hold ’em
down,” declared Coach Trayne.</p>

<p>New life had been infused into the team, however.
Villum Kess was capering around in right
field trying to stand on his head, and almost succeeding.
The ball was being snapped around the
bases in wonderful fashion. One and all, the
team were leaping into action as if the coming
of Merry and his friends had turned the tide.</p>

<p>Yet the score stood four to one, and the bases
were filled, there were none out.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>The Franklin batter stepped into his box.
Merry poised himself on the mound and nodded
at Billy’s eager signal.</p>

<p>Then Merry did a strange thing:</p>

<p>He knew that the men behind him had regained
confidence, and he proceeded to show his confidence
in them by lobbing over a slow, straight<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
ball. The batter almost gasped with astonishment,
but swung and took it on the nose.</p>

<p>“Wow!”</p>

<p>The crowd came up on its toes. The ball drove
across the field like a bullet, so quickly that it
could hardly be seen what had happened. The
shortstop put out his glove, and the ball struck.
Instantly he leaped to second.</p>

<p>The runners had leaped at the crack of the
bat. Touching second, the shortstop whipped the
ball to Clancy. It came straight and true, and
the man on first tried to get back, but too late.
Three men had been retired, in less than twenty
seconds from the time the ball was hit!</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” gasped Trayne, watching with
bulging eyes. “It’s incredible!”</p>

<p>The crowd went mad with excitement. Such
playing had rarely been seen on Fardale field
since the time of Frank Merriwell, senior. The
Fardale players had moved like clockwork, with
such absolute precision that they had accomplished
a triple play before they themselves realized
the fact!</p>

<p>Small wonder that the fans went crazy as the
team trotted in. The grand stand was in bedlam,
screaming and shouting and stamping. The
bleachers shrieked that the game was not lost yet,
and implored Crockett to send Merry to bat.</p>

<p>Crockett did not lose his head in the excitement,
however. He himself was up, and he was<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
fairly confident of a hit. As he strode out to the
plate, the uproar died away. After all, Franklin
was three runs to the good, and the case for
Fardale looked hopeless.</p>

<p>As it happened, Clancy, Billy Mac, and Chip
would come to bat in the order named.</p>

<p>Crockett fell on the first ball for a clean safety,
Clancy walked out and the Fardale followers
greeted him with a storm of yells.</p>

<p>These died into a groan, as Clancy swung twice
without result. Peters was a cool pitcher, and he
tried to tease Clancy into a third strike, but in
vain. With three balls, Clancy settled himself
for a good one.</p>

<p>It came over&mdash;a sharp drop. Clancy chopped at
it, and the ball went sizzling toward third. Instantly
Crockett was speeding toward second, and
managed to beat out the ball by an inch. Once
more the crowd went wild with excitement.</p>

<p>“A hit, Billy Mac!”</p>

<p>“Billy Mac to bat!”</p>

<p>“Win the game, Billy!”</p>

<p>Yell after yell pealed across the field, as Billy
Mac went forth. Peters conferred with his
catcher, and steadied down his rather demoralized
team, then went back to the box.</p>

<p>Billy looked like easy money. He swung widely
at two teasers, and Franklin began to grin. With
the next ball down, however, Billy suddenly
changed his tactics and met it on the nose. The<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
ball sailed up over second, continued its course
beyond reach of the center fielder, and, before it
was retrieved, two men had come in and Billy
was grinning happily from third.</p>

<p>“Four to three! Hurray!”</p>

<p>The band struck into “Fair Fardale” and hundreds
of voices picked up the song and thundered
it forth as Merry was seen to step toward the
plate, bat in hand. The chorus rose and shrilled
up into a wild scream, drowning out the Franklin
cries. Peters waited, then shot the ball down.</p>

<p>Frank struck&mdash;and missed.</p>

<p>Again Peters poised himself. Again he uncurled
his slim length and sent the white sphere
sizzling down. Again Merry swung wickedly at
it, and missed.</p>

<p>The song died away and settled into silence.
Peters grinned easily, glanced at Billy at third,
and sent another hot one over the plate.</p>

<p>Merry struck. A sharp crack, and the ball
began to rise. But the Franklin outfielders took
one look at it, then flung up their gloves and ran
in. It was a home run, and Fardale had won by
one run!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CAPTAIN OF THE NINE.</span></h2>


<p>“Hey, Chip! We got him!”</p>

<p>The players grouped about Coach Trayne in
the clubhouse turned. They had been waiting
for the arrival of Clancy and Billy Mac, who was
still to vote on the new captain, as the coach had
demanded a written ballot.</p>

<p>“By gracious!”</p>

<p>The exclamation burst from Merry. Between
Clancy and Billy was a drooping figure which he
recognized as that of Colonel Carson. The man’s
clothes were torn, and by the fierce glances he
cast around it was clear that he had not been captured
without a struggle.</p>

<p>“We knew he was somewhere,” explained the
panting Clancy. “So we went to the gate and
grabbed him. Let’s tar and feather him, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>Merry stepped out as the yell went up. He
flung Billy and Clancy aside, and faced the
frightened Colonel Carson.</p>

<p>“Colonel,” he said quietly, “I think you’d better
get out of town at once. You tried dirty work,
and I fancy that you’ve paid up for it, since you
intended betting on Franklin. Fade away, and
do it lively.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Carson faded.</p>

<p>“He plunged pretty heavily, I hear,” said
Trayne, holding back the indignant Fardale men.
“Let him go, boys. Merry’s right. Get in here
with your ballots, you fellows, and quit delaying
things!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, please,” said Chip. “I only
want to say that the fellow to be elected is Owen
Clancy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pho! Shut up, you rube!”</p>

<p>“Yah! Listen to der peesness! Go vay und
talk mit yourselluf, Frankie!”</p>

<p>“Clan didn’t knock the home run!”</p>

<p>Coach Trayne quieted down the yelling mob,
and roared for ballots. When he had written out
his, Merry turned to the silent and unhappy figure
of Bob Randall and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Bob,” he said, smiling, “I want to congratulate
you on your game to-day! That Franklin
chap, Peters, seems to have been a general surprise,
and with a smashed-up infield behind you, I
think you did remarkably well to keep them
down!”</p>

<p>Randall hesitated, then accepted Frank’s hand.
There was a quick glitter in his dark eyes as he
searched Merry’s face.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” he faltered. “You&mdash;you’re
not sarcastic?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not!” cried Merry warmly.
“Old man, if you’d had Clan and Billy in their<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
regular positions to steady things down, you’d
have won in a hand down!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Randall, and turned away.
“It’s&mdash;it’s mighty good of you, Chip.”</p>

<p>There were fifteen men present, counting the
substitutes, who, of course, each had a vote.
When the last ballot had been handed in, Coach
Trayne read them one by one. Then he held up
his hand.</p>

<p>“Men,” he said, “I received fifteen ballots in
the vote for a captain of the regular team to succeed
Captain Ted Crockett, who leaves Fardale
to-night. The results are as follows: One vote
for Randall, the other fourteen votes are all for
Merriwell, so I guess we can claim that the new
captain has been unanimously elected.”</p>

<p>A shouting mob surrounded Chip, who had, in
truth, been surprised. His thoughts had all been
with Colonel Carson, and he had failed utterly
to consider the captaincy. Through the crowd
pushed Randall, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>“And I want to congratulate you, Merry,” he
said simply, holding out his hand to Frank.
“You’re the man for the job!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, old man,” said Merry, as he met
Randall’s eyes. “I’m proud to have you behind
me!”</p>

<p>And their hands met, amid a renewed storm of
cheers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A CHALLENGE.</span></h2>


<p>“Where’s Bob Randall?”</p>

<p>“Search me, Chip. He didn’t turn up for
practice. Bet a dollar he’s still sore over not
getting elected captain.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Clan! He came around finely,
congratulated me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know all about that. But the galoot got
hot all over again, when he got to thinking it
over! I know his kind. He goes on impulse.”</p>

<p>Merry turned away. Despite his efforts to
convince himself to the contrary, he knew that
Clancy was right. Randall “went on impulse.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do the best I can,” thought Merry
anxiously. “Bob is too fine a fellow to do this.
If I leave Fardale he ought to be captain, I
think.”</p>

<p>The first and second teams were at practice
on the Fardale ball field. There was an hour
left before the drums would sound assembly for
supper formation, and Merry was putting his
men through their paces.</p>

<p>“I hear there’s no game for Saturday,” said
Billy McQuade, joining Merry.</p>

<p>“Right. Had to be canceled. I’m sorry, because
I may have to leave next week, and I’d like
to play one more game&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>Frank broke off abruptly as the cadet orderly
from Colonel Gunn’s office came up and saluted.</p>

<p>“Telegram, just arrived.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Merry took the message and tore it open. A
cry of amazement broke from him, followed by
an incredulous laugh. Then he turned.</p>

<p>“Mr. Trayne! Clan! Come over here!”</p>

<p>Coach Trayne and Clancy joined him, and
Merry proceeded to read the message aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Frank Merriwell, Junior</span>, Captain Fardale Baseball
Team: The Carsonville Clippers challenge you to a game
next Saturday, at Fardale. Anxious to meet regular Fardale
team. Wire my expense.</p>

<p class="center p-1 shiftright">“<span class="smcap">Colonel Carson</span>, Owner.”</p></div>

<p>Frank looked up, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, talk about nerve!”</p>

<p>“Nerve!” cried Clancy. “After you went over
to Carsonville, picked up a team, and beat them!
After Colonel Carson and his son tried to keep
you out of the Franklin game last Saturday by
kidnaping you! Nerve’s no name for it, Chip.
Tell ’em to go to thunder.”</p>

<p>“That fellow’s a pirate!” cried Billy Mac excitedly.
“Wire him a hundred words collect with
a kick at the end, Chip!”</p>

<p>“There’s something crooked behind this,” declared
Clancy hotly. “The Clippers are crooked
clear through, Chip, and we’d better not mix up
with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>“They’re an amateur team, though,” said Coach
Trayne doubtfully. “It’d be a good game, boys.”</p>

<p>“Sure it would,” added Billy Mac scornfully.
“Colonel Carson wants to recoup for his losses,
Mr. Trayne. He has the reputation of being a
dirty gambler, and there’s something behind the
challenge, you can be sure of that!”</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>“His crooked work doesn’t seem to have won
for him, just the same! Look here, fellows,
there’s no game Saturday, so we might accept
this. It will be lots of fun to pound Bully Carson
out of the lot.”</p>

<p>“I guess Bully won’t pitch,” declared Clancy,
with a grin. “It’d take him more than a week
to get over what I did to him, Chip.</p>

<p>“That’s one thing that looks queer to me,” continued
the red-haired chap. “You can bet a fistful
that Colonel Carson isn’t out for sport, Chip.
He’s out for revenge and boodle, and he doesn’t
care how he gets either, so long as he gets it.”</p>

<p>“Let him come after it,” said Coach Trayne.
“There’s no prospect of getting another game
for Saturday, and the athletic association can
use the money. That game would draw a big
crowd, Clancy.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to let him yell that we had
cold feet,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Billy Mac grunted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>“But what’s the sense in playing him, Chip?
We ought to have that shyster put in jail for
kidnaping you, and we could do it, and his son,
too. Everybody knows his crowd is crooked
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So much the more glory in beating them
squarely,” said Frank. “What do you think about
it, Mr. Trayne?”</p>

<p>“It looks all right to me,” returned the coach.
“I’d say to take the game, and then lick the stuffing
out of those fellows. We’re playing the Clippers,
you know, not Colonel Carson himself.
They could certainty raise a holler if we refused,
for they’re the crack team of the Amateur
League. We’ve no good reason for turning them
down, except on the score of crookedness, which
we can’t raise against the team as a whole. Carson’s
private dirty work doesn’t blanket his whole
team, remember.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Clancy, “but the team is a
bad lot, too. They tried to beat up Chip, Billy,
and me down at Carsonville, after our pick-ups
licked them. But you suit yourself, Merry. I’ll
stand back of you.”</p>

<p>“Same here, Chip,” said Billy. “I’d just as
soon help to do the bunch up brown, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Frank. “I see the practice
game is over, so I’ll trot across to the office
and phone down a telegram of acceptance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, Merriwell,” said Coach<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
Trayne, stopping him, “who are you working out
to fill Crockett’s place?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Trayne, my choice happens to be
holding down second right now,” and Frank
looked across the diamond with a twinkle. “What
do you think of him?”</p>

<p>The party turned. Standing awkwardly on
second and waiting for a grounder from the batter
was Villum Kess. He stood full on the sack
itself, as though firmly determined not to let it
get away from him. A burst of laughter went
up, though Trayne kept silent.</p>

<p>“Him!” cried Clancy derisively. “He’s done
nothing but right field up to now, Chip! Why,
he’ll fall all over the infield!”</p>

<p>“He’s a joke,” said Billy Mac. “Oh, my eye!
Look at that!”</p>

<p>Clancy gasped. As the batter sent a twisting
grounder at the place Kess should have been
standing, the German youth appeared to lose his
balance and topple from the bag. He stumbled
over his own foot, tried to recover in vain, and
went headlong to the ground in front of the ball.
By some weird chance it seemed to hit his glove,
and as he sat up he grinned and tossed it to
first.</p>

<p>“Dot vos der pusiness!” he squawked, as every
one roared with laughter. “Yaw! Didn’t you
toldt me so? You pet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>“Talk about luck!” gasped Clancy. “Surely
you’re not in earnest, Chip?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Merry. “Maybe it’s luck, but I’ve
noticed that Villum always makes the luck break
his way, Clan. Get out to first and see if you
can make him miss your pegs. If you can, I’ll
reverse my decision.”</p>

<p>Clancy trotted off with a whoop, and Coach
Trayne smiled.</p>

<p>“I wish you were going to stay at Fardale as
captain, Chip! You’d either smash up the team
or else it would be a wonder to behold!”</p>

<p>“Thanks for them kind words,” said Frank,
with a chuckle, moving away. “You can announce
that game for Saturday, Mr. Trayne!”</p>

<p>And he departed for Colonel Gunn’s office, in
order to telephone his wire to the village.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LAYING THE WIRES.</span></h2>


<p>It was commonly reported around Carsonville
that the estimable Colonel Carson could tug more
Satanic inspiration out of his yellow-gray goatee
than Satan himself. At the present moment he
seemed to be highly satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>He was sitting in his study at Carsonville, and
with him was his son. Bully Carson’s face was
decorated with a large black eye, over which he
wore an eye patch.</p>

<p>He was clad in a loud checked suit, flaming-red
necktie, and green waistcoat. From one corner
of his mouth drooped a negligent cigarette. His
face looked pasty and unwholesome, and reflected
the same hard, unscrupulous look that shone in
his father’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Son, here’s where we even up with them Merriwells
for good and all.”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson tugged at his goatee again, and
glanced down at Merry’s telegram of acceptance.
He used the Clippers as a means to win money
by gambling. And when he did gamble, it was
usually a sure thing. This he proceeded to prove
in his next words.</p>

<p>“Bully, I’m going to clean up a lot on this here
Fardale game,” he stated reflectively. “I got
word to-night that Southpaw Diggs will come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>“Whew!” Bully peered at his father in admiration.
“Pop, you’re a slick one! Ain’t you afraid
they’ll recognize him?”</p>

<p>“Not at Fardale. He’ll take a fictitious name
and shave off his mustache. I’m going to pay him
well for it. Also, I’ve got a semipro catcher to
take the place of Squint Fletcher, whom some of
the town boys trounced. Squint was always insolent,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bully, with a scowl. “He didn’t
have no respect for me at all. Then you’ve got
two other fellers from that outlaw league, ain’t
you?”</p>

<p>“For first and third,” replied his father. “Our
own second baseman is excellent, and with Southpaw
Diggs we’ll have a walk-away, son.”</p>

<p>Bully nodded. Diggs was a famous professional
pitcher. In his good days he was one of
the best in the country, but he had been let out
by the last team he had been with for drunkenness.</p>

<p>“Sure Diggs won’t get boozed up, pop?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure. He has agreed to let me bet half
the amount I am to pay him on our team. He’s
also agreed not to touch a drop meantime, and,
as he needs the money, we can depend on him
fully.”</p>

<p>Carson, junior, looked down at the floor, then
lifted his one good eye suddenly.</p>

<p>“Pop, I want some money,” he blurted out. “I<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
want to get down some bets on this game for myself,
and I’m busted.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” and his father’s eyes narrowed.
“I’ll make a clean-up for the family,
son.”</p>

<p>“Aw, loosen up!” exclaimed Bully disgustedly.
“You durned old tightwad, you got more dollars
in the bank than I have cents! Why, you own the
bank, yet you won’t come over with a hundred!”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” cried Colonel Carson, horrified
at the mere idea. “Ain’t I brought you up
all your life? Ain’t I paid for them clothes you
got on?”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t holler so about it,” retorted
his son. “I want some coin, hear that? I’m tired
o’ lollin’ around without any money to go on, and
I’m goin’ to have some.”</p>

<p>“Get out and rustle for it, then, like I did,” retorted
his father grimly.</p>

<p>Bully grunted with contempt. He had the same
keen love for dollars that his father had, but he
did not possess the elder Carson’s aptitude to pick
up cents. However, he fully intended to get hold
of some money to bet on the Fardale game.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the Clippers would
win, none at all. With Diggs on the mound the
academy team would be helpless, to say nothing
of the other professionals who would masquerade
as amateurs for the occasion. It was a “raw
deal,” but Colonel Carson was famed in sporting<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
circles for his ability to put raw deals over successfully.</p>

<p>“This is the surest kind of a good thing,” he
mused reflectively. “If Diggs shows up in good
shape, Bully, I’ll get down about a thousand that
we shut them out without a run.”</p>

<p>“You’d better go easy on them fancy bets,”
growled Bully. “That Merriwell kid is liable to
connect with a streak of luck and jab out a homer,
like he done against Franklin. You thought that
was a sure thing, too.”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson winced. Merriwell’s homer on
that occasion had cost him more money than he
liked to think about.</p>

<p>“You may be right, Bully,” he said slowly. “But
he would be helpless before Southpaw Diggs.”</p>

<p>“He’s got the durndest luck you ever seen,” insisted
Bully doggedly.</p>

<p>Colonel Carson began to pull at his goatee once
more, frowning at the floor. He knew that Merriwell’s
success was not so much due to good luck
as it was to pluck, skill, and honesty. He could
not blind himself to this, but the knowledge only
swerved his mind toward vindictiveness.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied slowly, “it isn’t all luck, son.
Just the same, I’ve no fears that he’ll be able to
buck Diggs. There’s no harm in making sure
against all chance, however. If we could get him
out of the way, Randall would pitch. That’d cinch
the whole thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>“Huh!” sniffed Bully. “You said that once before&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” snapped his father violently. “I’ve
had enough of your insolence! We’ll fix that kid
this time, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“You will, you mean. Count me out right here,
pop! I’ve had all I want o’ that kid, and if there’s
any ‘fixing’ to do, I ain’t goin’ to mix in it. No,
I’m cured, I am, and I reckon I’ll stay cured quite
a spell.”</p>

<p>He felt his injured eye tenderly. His father
continued to pull at his goatee, and suddenly he
nodded in decision and rose.</p>

<p>Going to a cabinet that stood against the wall,
he opened a small drawer and extracted a tiny
folded paper. With this in his hand, he returned
to Bully.</p>

<p>“All right, son, we’ll let your goody-goody
Cousin Bob Randall handle this for us. You go
over to Fardale to-morrow and see him. Give him
this”&mdash;and he held up the folded paper&mdash;“and tell
him to get Merriwell to drink it any time in the
forenoon next Saturday. It’s a powder, and all
Randall will have to do is to shake it into a glass
of water. It’ll fix him.”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson’s eyes were malevolent as he
spoke. Bully hung back, however.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, pop,” he cried, with something
like fear, “I ain’t goin’ to mix up in no poisoning&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>“Shut up, you fool!” snarled his father, glancing
around. “This ain’t poison, but a powder
that’ll send him off into a sound sleep for a while.
It won’t hurt him in any fashion, but it’ll put him
out o’ the game for sure.”</p>

<p>“But what about Randall?” Bully queried
weakly. “You tried to get him to throw the game
with Franklin, and he got sore. He ain’t the
kind to do this, pop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I sized him up pretty well,” chuckled the
elder Carson wickedly. “Now listen, Bully: You
work this right, and I’ll give you ten per cent of
all I win on the game, see? This part of it depends
on you, and you can do it fine.</p>

<p>“Go to Fardale and get hold of Randall. Talk
to him slow and easy, and get him madder and
madder. He’ll be sore about not getting elected
captain, anyhow. Work on that string. Play
him good and strong, and get him to promise that
he’ll give the stuff to Merriwell. Then we’ve got
him. He’s one o’ them fellers who’ll stick to a
promise, no matter what comes. But you’ll have
to handle it right.”</p>

<p>“You can trust me for that,” said Bully, with
a growl, as he took the paper.</p>

<p>His eyes shone with vindictive cunning. He
had tried to injure Merriwell, but vainly. Therefore,
it was quite natural that he should bear bitter
hatred toward the fellow he had tried to injure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>He saw that by working through Randall he
would be freed of all personal responsibility, and
this thought cheered on his little soul. He was
willing enough to do anything for which another
could be made to suffer, and this sort of chicanery
was precisely what he could do well.</p>

<p>None the less, he did not forget that he wanted
money. He saw that his father’s scheme depended
upon him, and grinned evilly.</p>

<p>“Now, come across, pop!”</p>

<p>“Hey?” Colonel Carson glared. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“Come across, I said!” Bully lolled back negligently
in his chair, and eyed his father coolly.
“I ain’t workin’ for my health.”</p>

<p>“Confound your insolence!” sputtered the other
angrily. “You’re working for me! I’ll give you
no money to squander, you reprobate!”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doing, then, old tightwad,” and Bully
made as if to hand back the folded paper. He
carelessly took his cigarette from his mouth and
exhaled a cloud of vile-smelling smoke.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;do you mean&mdash;do you refuse to go to
Fardale?” Colonel Carson was almost speechless
with rage.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know!”</p>

<p>Colonel Carson reached into his pocket and
drew out two five-dollar bills.</p>

<p>“Here’s ten dollars&mdash;take it or leave it. Go to<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
Fardale and stay over Saturday. Use this as expense
money.”</p>

<p>Bully sniffed, and his father exploded:</p>

<p>“You’ll do what I say! Take this expense
money and work this business, and you get ten
per cent of the winnings. Refuse, and you can
go to the dickens for all o’ me! I’ll not have a
worthless thing like you loafin’ around here any
longer, understand?”</p>

<p>It was the first time Bully had ever seen his
father aroused against him, and he was cowed.
Reaching out, he took the money and put it in his
pocket with the paper.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “I’ll do it.” But to himself
he muttered sullenly: “And I’ll have a wad
to bet on that game&mdash;somehow!”</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought you’d come around, son!”</p>

<p>And once more Colonel Carson complacently
tugged at his goatee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH.</span></h2>


<p>With eight dollars in his pocket, after purchasing
his railroad ticket, Bully Carson climbed
aboard the express.</p>

<p>He did not go into a Pullman, for that would
cost more money. Instead, he sauntered up to
the smoking car, rolling a cigarette as he went.
For this occasion he had abandoned his “swellest”
clothes, being simply clad in a black-and-white,
shiny-buttoned suit that shrieked aloud, a plain
orange-and-white necktie, and a pair of patent-leather
shoes with green uppers. Bully desired to
avoid all prominence during his stay in Fardale,
and so had picked out his meekest raiment for
the trip.</p>

<p>He found the smoking car fairly well filled, and
with his mind still occupied with the subject of
raising some money with which to bet for himself,
he dropped into a seat beside a small, dried-up
little man.</p>

<p>Now, there are many people who gauge other
people’s importance by their clothes, and who do
so without any regard for taste. Ezra Hostetter
had run a laundry all his life, and he was the
simplest-hearted person that ever ironed a collar.
Being of extremely dull taste as regarded his own<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
attire, he entertained an unlimited admiration for
those fortunate men who could afford and carry
off gorgeous apparel with perfect ease.</p>

<p>Consequently, he directed one startled glance at
Bully’s glorious harmony of colors, and was lost.
With honest longing stamped on his face, he directed
sly but highly admiring side looks that
feasted on everything from the green-topped
shoes to the scarlet-and-blue hatband incasing
Bully’s purple felt hat.</p>

<p>To be sure, the eye patch slightly detracted
from Bully’s appearance. Ezra Hostetter began
to swell with importance at sitting next this ornate
personage. Possibly it was a prize fighter,
or, at the very least, a follower of sports!</p>

<p>Not being a judge of character, the little man
stole further worshiping glances as Bully grandly
lighted his cigarette and snapped the match away.
Being an excellent judge of character and delighting
in posing, Bully was not slow to detect
the point-blank admiration of his seatmate, and
to delight in it.</p>

<p>“Fine weather, ain’t it?” he remarked condescendingly.
“Goin’ to Fardale?”</p>

<p>Ezra Hostetter jumped, then stammered out
an overjoyed assent:</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going to buy a laundry there, Mr.&mdash;&mdash; Mr.&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Carson,” prompted Bully, settling his thumbs<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
in his vest and leaning back. “Ed Carson, of
Carsonville. I’m glad to meet you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hostetter, Ezra Hostetter,” said the dried-up
little laundryman.</p>

<p>Bully positively basked during the next few
moments. He had had little opportunity to do any
basking around home, of late, and the chance was
too good to be missed. And since he could also
be very genial when he chose, he soon fell into
a conversation with Hostetter which was extremely
pleasant on both sides.</p>

<p>He did not uncase his splendor all at once, however.
Having seen the simplicity of his companion’s
heart, he began to take a keen delight in
letting him discover his grandeur by degrees.</p>

<p>It seemed that Hostetter had heard of Colonel
Carson, and, upon discovering that he was talking
with that famous man’s son, his admiration
eclipsed all bounds. After a little he ventured a
timid query as to Bully’s profession.</p>

<p>“I’m a ball player,” announced Bully, with quiet
dignity. “Not a professional, y’ understand,
though I may consider an offer from the Giants
this summer.”</p>

<p>This was the final straw. Poor Hostetter,
blinded by the limitations of his own experience,
carried away by the glamour of Bully’s wondrous
raiment, positively groveled. And Bully continued
to bask in open-mouthed admiration of<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
the other, until it occurred to him that he had
better account for his black eye.</p>

<p>“I got this in my last game,” and he lightly
touched the patch. “I was pitching, and the batter
hit out a liner at me. I tried to stop it, but the
ball broke through my hands and struck my eye.
Even so, I caught it before it reached the ground,
and so won the game.”</p>

<p>He reeled off this fabrication with amazing
ease. Across the aisle was seated a man who
had got on at Carsonville, and who knew nothing
of how Bully had really obtained that injured
optic. He grinned, and nudged the man beside
him. Bully did not notice it, however.</p>

<p>Presently the conversation became even more
personal. Bully discovered that his companion
was proceeding to Fardale to invest in a laundry
there, which was for sale. After a cautious
glance around, Hostetter pulled forth a long black
wallet and opened it out.</p>

<p>“Look at this!” he exclaimed proudly, anxious
to prove to the great man that he, too, had symptoms
of nobility. “There’s a thousand dollars in
cash&mdash;in cash, mind you! I’m going to buy that
laundry with it.”</p>

<p>Bully leaned over. At sight of the ten hundred-dollar
bills his senses reeled, and sparks
danced before his eyes. A thousand dollars in
cash!</p>

<p>“By glory!” he gasped inwardly. “If I only<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
had that much, what a clean-up I’d make on this
Fardale game!”</p>

<p>He was more cautious in expressing his
thoughts aloud, however.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you get a draft? You could ’a’
cashed it at Fardale in the morning. Ain’t you
afraid some one will hold you up?”</p>

<p>“It’s kind o’ risky,” admitted the little man, replacing
the wallet. “But I don’t like to trust to
banks, Carson. I had a bank bust on me once,
in Chicago, and I ain’t never going to trust ’em
again. I guess no one’s going to hold me up,
though.”</p>

<p>Bully pulled down his hat over his eyes. He
knew that they were glittering covetously, and
he desired to hide the glitter from his companion.</p>

<p>A thousand dollars in cash! The words drove
through his brain over and over, and fitted themselves
into a refrain that chimed with the click
and clatter of the wheels underneath him.</p>

<p>He had visions of himself nonchalantly sauntering
through the grand stand, waving those
hundred-dollar bills and petrifying the Fardale
fans with his grandeur. The more he thought it
over, the more the idea appealed to him, and the
more he mentally condemned his father for a
tightwad.</p>

<p>“He’s just rolling in money,” he thought sullenly,
“and here I am almost without a cent! I’ll
have to run close to the wind to make this eight<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
dollars last me, at that. If I only had that thousand
in cash, I guess I’d cut a swath in Fardale!”</p>

<p>Bitter and black thoughts filled his mind during
the remainder of the journey. Little by little his
mind edged to the conviction that he was a badly
injured person, and that he was quite justified in
resenting the injury in any manner possible. After
all, he had warned his father quite fairly that he
intended to raise some money, and if his father
refused to take the warning&mdash;so much the worse
for him!</p>

<p>“What hotel do you patronize here, Mr. Carson?”
asked Hostetter, as the train was pulling
into Fardale.</p>

<p>“Me?” responded Bully, with careless magnificence.
“Oh, I usually frequent the Dobbs Hotel.
Are you going there?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;well, to tell the truth, I&mdash;I think I
will,” said Hostetter. “It ain’t expensive?”</p>

<p>Bully grinned to himself, fingering his eight
dollars.</p>

<p>“Not ’specially so. I’d be glad to have your
company, old man.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” and the other glanced about
nervously. “You see, Carson, I’d feel a little bit
safer if I had a friend in the vicinity. Of course
there’s no danger, only I can’t transact my business
till the morning, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give your money to the hotel proprietor,” suggested
Bully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>“Not me! I’ll keep it right on me all the time,
and if I lose it, it’s my own fault. I wouldn’t trust
any hotel man that ever lived!”</p>

<p>“Well, I dunno’s you’re wrong,” said Bully,
nodding sagely. “Come along&mdash;we’ll get supper
at a restaurant, if you like, then go up to the
hotel.”</p>

<p>At this proposal the little man fluttered with
conscious pride. They left the train and entered
a restaurant together. Here, Bully found that
his raiment created a sensation, that was highly
soothing to his spirits. After supper they went
to the Dobbs Hotel and registered, being given
rooms directly across the hall from each other.</p>

<p>Bully Carson had already sent a message to
Randall, informing him of his arrival and
stating that he wanted to see him that evening
at the hotel. He knew that his cousin would
have little difficulty in evading the academy regulations
about being out of the grounds after
taps.</p>

<p>However, Bully’s thoughts were still running
on that thousand dollars in cash. Reaching his
room before Hostetter arrived, for the latter had
paused to telephone the men with whom he was
to do business, Bully covertly took the key from
his own door and tried it in that across the hall.</p>

<p>The key worked both locks!</p>

<p>A few moments later the little man arrived at
the room which had been assigned to him. He<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
soon came over and knocked on Carson’s door,
entering with a worried expression on his face.</p>

<p>“The bolt on my door is broken,” he exclaimed.
“Do you think it’ll be quite safe there, or had I
better get another room?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re all right,” Bully said carelessly.
“Lock the door and put the key in your pocket&mdash;don’t
leave it in the door, or it can be turned from
outside. Then shove that wallet under your pillow,
and you’re safer’n if you was locked up in
a vault. It’s a cinch, old man!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take your advice,” said Hostetter,
with a relieved air. “Much obliged to you, I’m
sure!”</p>

<p>Saying good night, he vanished. Bully could
hear him lock his door and withdraw the key.</p>

<p>Carson sat smoking until the room was so full
of smoke that he was forced to open the window,
much against his will. A thousand dollars in
cash! The words seemed to burn into his brain.
He walked up and down, trying to fling off the
black thoughts that filled him, but finally he
paused and brought down one fist on the table.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>At that instant there came a soft knock at the
door. Bully started, and swung around. The
door opened.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you!” he cried, and laughed a little.
“Come in, Bob. I was waiting for you.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CRIMINAL WORK.</span></h2>


<p>Bob Randall slipped quickly inside, shut the
door swiftly behind him, and stood as if listening.</p>

<p>On his high, dark, and undeniably handsome
face there was a look of mingled worry and
anger. His eyes seemed haggard, and Bully Carson
chuckled to himself as he recalled what his
father had said about Randall brooding over a
fancied injury. It was quite plain that Randall
was in good shape to be worked on.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Bully. “What
you listenin’ for?”</p>

<p>Randall dropped into a chair, wiping his brow.</p>

<p>“I thought old man Dobbs had seen me come
in,” he explained nervously. “You see, I got
held up at school, couldn’t get away earlier, and
had to sneak past the guards. I came in the hotel
by the back entrance.”</p>

<p>“How’ll you get back to your room?”</p>

<p>“Easy,” said the Southerner. “Rope to the
window. I won’t want to be seen around here,
though, or I might get reported. Old Dobbs
knows me by sight.”</p>

<p>Carson nodded, and flung himself into a chair.</p>

<p>“I hear you got beaten to the captaincy of the
nine,” he observed. “That kid Merriwell seems
to cop out everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>Randall’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“What did you want to see me about?” he said,
with a scowl.</p>

<p>“About Merriwell,” Bully stated calmly. “Of
course, he’s got you slated to pitch against the
Clippers Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Yes he has&mdash;not!” Randall lost his temper,
and slipped into his Southern dialect as usual
when he became excited.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t pitch if he did! I’ve had enough
of these heah Yankee ways! I’m goin’ to leave
Fahdale, Cahson, for wheah a man doesn’t hog
it all because his fatheh is a big athlete! I cain’t
swallow it and I won’t!”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” said Bully approvingly. “He
has certainly treated you mis’ably, old hoss. You
ought to be captain of the Fardale team right
now! It ain’t fair treatment, I say.”</p>

<p>“I reckon not! These low-down Yankees
truckle to him abjectly, Cahson. You-all haven’t
any idea of what goes on heah! When we played
Franklin last Satuhday, that fellow held out the
best men on the team until I was beaten. Then
he showed up, put ’em in, and managed to win
with luck.”</p>

<p>Randall leaned back, trying to collect himself.
Bully chuckled quietly. It was evident that his
cousin had worked himself up into a riotous state
of mind.</p>

<p>Randall was honestly convinced that his version<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
of the Franklin game was the true one. Had
he pitched and won, he would have been elected
captain. He pitched, and was being knocked out
of the box when Merry arrived in the ninth inning
and saved the game.</p>

<p>All Fardale knew that Merriwell had been held
prisoner, and that Clancy and Billy Mac had rescued
him, all three appearing in the nick of time.
Yet Randall only accepted that as a story put
forth by Merry.</p>

<p>He had brooded by himself, had pointedly
avoided Chip on the baseball field, and gradually
managed to get himself into a badly overwrought
condition. Twisting every little incident, seeing
everything in the light of his jealousy and bitterness,
it was not hard for him to convince himself
that he was the victim of a cleverly executed
plot.</p>

<p>His state of mind was a bad one, and would
require some severe and sharp correction before
his angle of vision could be straightened. Fortunately
for himself, he had not attempted to convince
any one else on the subject.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Bully encouraged him, playing
his cards cunningly. “He’s done you dirt, Bob,
for a fact. You ought to get even with him.”</p>

<p>“What chance have I?” Randall asked bitterly.
“I’m all alone here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno about that. Pop and me, we figure
to stand by our kin, Bob. Didn’t he try to<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
help you by keepin’ Merriwell out o’ that Franklin
game?”</p>

<p>Randall nodded, forcing himself into a strained
calmness.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I want you to thank him for me, old
man. It was no use, though.”</p>

<p>“Virtue is its own reward,” quoted Bully. “We
done our best. Now, pop would like to see you
pitch against the Clippers on Saturday, Bob. O’
course, we mean to beat you, but I ain’t goin’ to
be in the game, and pop would like to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No chance,” broke in Randall, with renewed
bitterness. Then he glanced up, half suspiciously.
“Why is your father so interested?”</p>

<p>“Because he likes you, Bob.”</p>

<p>Bully was too wise to persuade Randall along
crooked lines. He sneered at his cousin, in his
own mind, for being a “goody-goody” fellow.</p>

<p>“I’d like to even up with Merriwell, Bob,” he
went on cautiously. “We’d like to have you pitch
Saturday ’cause you’re a better pitcher than Merriwell.
We’ve got a new pitcher for the Clippers,
and if we beat Fardale at its best, there’ll be all
the more glory in it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Colonel Carson intends to do some
betting?” Bob queried keenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, a little, mebbe. Not much. Now see here,
Bob: This guy Merriwell ain’t used you right,
to my notion. He’s played dirty against you, and
he’s got all Fardale persuaded that he’s a little<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
tin god on wheels, with a bell to his neck. There
ain’t no use tryin’ to hit back at him fair and
square. We got to use his own methods.”</p>

<p>Bully worked himself into a virtuous glow. He
almost believed his own words.</p>

<p>“You tried ’em last Sunday,” retorted Bob
gloomily. “They didn’t work.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know just how slick he was, Bob.
He could ’a’ got away from us sooner, only he
wanted to come in at the last minute for a grand-stand
play. He thinks that if he pitches against
the Clippers he’s sure to win. But we’d sooner
have you pitch, ’cause you ain’t crooked. We
want to play a clean game; get me?”</p>

<p>Randall nodded. Wrapped up in his own
thoughts, he did not even attempt to penetrate
Bully’s sudden show of conscious virtue.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Carson. And I’d sure like to
hand him one hot one before I leave school!”</p>

<p>“You’d hand it to him if you pitched against
the Clippers, Bob. I’ll pass it to you on the quiet
that we don’t know much about our new pitcher,
and he might pan out wrong. If he does, you
stand a chance o’ winning the game. Of course,
I want to see the Clippers win, but if you could
beat us square, I’d be satisfied. It’d make this
Merriwell kid squirm ten ways from election.”</p>

<p>Randall could readily understand that, according
to his notions of Merry’s character.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he assented, growing excited as the<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
golden vision arose before him. “Yes, I reckon
yo’ ce’tainly have it doped out. If that could come
about, he’d sho’ learn a bitteh lesson, the low-down
scoundrel!”</p>

<p>Bully grinned to himself. He could read his
cousin like a book, and was playing on the other
with beautiful precision.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, pop and I figgered up a plan. It
ain’t a nice plan, but this is our last chance to
slip one over on Merriwell. He ain’t played the
gentleman in his dealings with you, and we don’t
mind fightin’ fire with fire for once.”</p>

<p>This amazing display of innocence did not astonish
Randall. He knew little of his precious
relatives, and Bully’s assumed hesitation seemed
quite natural to him.</p>

<p>“Neither do I!” he growled, in return. “Where
he is concerned, Carson, I’d feel justified in doing
anything!”</p>

<p>“Then do this, Cousin Bob.”</p>

<p>While he spoke, Bully took from his pocket the
carefully folded paper that had been given him
by his father. Randall looked at it.</p>

<p>“Here’s the plan we figgered out, Bob: To get
Merriwell out o’ this here game, we got to keep
him out by force. It ain’t no use appealing to
his fairness. He ain’t got any such thing!”</p>

<p>“Force won’t work, here at Fardale,” muttered
Bob.</p>

<p>“But this powder will,” said Bully, leaning forward<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
and dropping his voice. “Hold on!” he
cried, as Randall gave a quick start. “It ain’t
only a sleepin’ potion, Bob. If you could get
Merriwell to drink it any time Saturday mornin’,
which is to-morrow, he’d sleep clear through till
supper time. They couldn’t wake him up, and if
they did he wouldn’t be no good.”</p>

<p>Randall flushed, drawing back.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad business,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“So’s your losing out for captain, Bob. Go
in and win this game. What if Merriwell does
know you doped him? He can’t prove it. If you
win the game, you’ll show him up for fair. If you
get beat, they’ll say he got cold feet. You win
comin’ and goin’, and we’ll even things up with
him once and for all. What say?”</p>

<p>Randall still hesitated. Looking at the folded
paper which his cousin held out to him, the criminality
of the thing appalled him. His chivalrous
nature rebelled at the very thought.</p>

<p>But Bully’s cunning words worked on his mind.
His fancied wrongs loomed up large on his mental
horizon. Once more a flood of bitterness swept
over him, and he felt himself justified in doing
anything.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he said thickly, and took the paper.</p>

<p>“Promise?”</p>

<p>“My word is my promise,” cried Randall, half
angrily. Then he glanced around with sudden
alarm. “Say, I’ve been here too long. See if any<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
one’s in the hall, so I can get out the back way
to the side street.”</p>

<p>Bully opened the door and announced that the
coast was clear. On this Randall silently shook
hands with him, then stole off down the corridor
on tiptoe.</p>

<p>For a moment Bully watched, then his eyes
went to the opposite door. In the silence he could
plainly hear a gentle, regular snore. Still watching
that door, he drew the key from his own
lock.</p>

<p>Then he snapped off his own light, and in two
quick steps was across the hall. For an instant
he fumbled at the door, with deft fingers that
turned back the lock in perfect silence. Slowly
and cautiously he pressed the knob and opened the
door.</p>

<p>Half a moment later he reappeared and locked
the door as silently as he had unlocked it. Darting
swiftly into his room, he switched on the light
and drew something from his pocket, examining
it swiftly. His eyes glittered, and he again
snapped off his light and undressed in the darkness,
carefully stowing away the object in his
coat pocket.</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars in cash!” he murmured, as
he crept into bed. “Pop, if you could only see
me now!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BEFORE THE GAME.</span></h2>


<p>“How’s everything, Chip?”</p>

<p>“Great, Mr. Trayne! We’re going to do some
topside playing this afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said the coach, with a smile.
“Have you decided to keep Kess at second?”</p>

<p>“If you approve, sir. Lowe at third, Harker
at short, and O’Day in Villum’s place in right.
It’s a new line-up, but I think it’s tremendously
strengthened.”</p>

<p>Coach Trayne nodded quick assent.</p>

<p>“You’ve done wonders with those chaps already,
Chip! Crockett was a dandy captain, but
he seemed content to keep the men in their old
positions. This change of yours is going to give
the fans a big surprise.”</p>

<p>“And a pleasant one, I hope.” Merry’s smile
suddenly died away. “Only I’m not quite certain
about the pitching end.”</p>

<p>“What!” Coach Trayne’s face expressed sudden
concern. “Aren’t you going in?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. But I was thinking what would
happen if anything went wrong with me, or if I
got pounded badly. You see, Randall is our best
substitute man, and he’s been acting badly lately.
He refused to come out to practice the last two<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
days, and virtually announced that he was
through with baseball.”</p>

<p>“I know,” and the coach looked worried. “Personally,
I’d like to kick him around the block,
Chip! But for the school’s sake we ought to try
to placate him.”</p>

<p>It was late Saturday morning, the day of the
game with the Carsonville Clippers. Everything
looked bright for Fardale. The Clippers were due
to arrive on the noon train, and, as their reputation
was great, a record crowd was expected.
Word had spread around that this might be Chip
Merriwell’s last game for the season, and excitement
was intense.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry, though,” advised the coach.
“You’re all right, old man, and those Clippers
will never get to you. We won’t need Randall.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mr. Trayne. The Clippers are
amateurs, but they’re crack players. Still, I
wasn’t thinking of the game alone. I may go
away next week, and if Randall can only be
brought into a right frame of mind, he’d make a
great captain.”</p>

<p>Trayne flung him a keen look.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it? After the way he’s acted
toward you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Chip soberly, “I think that he’s
merely viewed things wrongly, and I feel now
that he’d make the best captain of any one on
the team. I think I’ll run up to his room right<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
now, Mr. Trayne. I’ll have a frank talk with him,
and it may be that I can win him around.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea, Merriwell. If you can
do so, it’ll surely be a great good thing for Fardale.
We can’t afford to have a man of his caliber
brooding over his imagined wrongs. Good luck
to you, and let me know how he shows up.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Chip, and he turned away toward
the barracks.</p>

<p>As regarded his leaving Fardale, Chip himself
knew very little. He had heard from his father
that they were going West, together with Dick
Merriwell, and that he must hold himself in readiness
to leave when his father sent for him at a
moment’s notice. Therefore, it was possible that
this was his last diamond work for Fardale.</p>

<p>The cause of this summons was a mystery to
him, but he knew that he would find out in due
course. In fact, he was looking forward to the
trip with no little anticipation. Frank Merriwell,
junior, was a chip of the old block in nickname
and in fact, and he knew that with his father and
his Uncle Dick he was apt to experience a lively
time.</p>

<p>He quickly made his way to the room in barracks
occupied by Bob Randall. At his knock,
the Southerner’s voice called “Come in!” and
Frank entered.</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>Randall came to his feet, fists clenched and eyes<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
flashing. He had been sitting beside a table, on
which lay a pitcher of water and some books.
Evidently he had been trying to get through some
study.</p>

<p>“I’d like a talk with you, Bob,” said Merry
quietly. He took no heed of the other’s constrained
attitude.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Randall, his innate hospitality
showing through his anger. “I’m rather surprised
to find you coming here, Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would be,” and Frank coolly
plunged into the discussion, without any false
premises. “I’ve observed that you’re worked up
over something, Randall. More than one fellow
has told me that you’re sore at me over my getting
elected captain, and I wanted to straighten
things out with you if I could.”</p>

<p>Randall trembled with anger, and seemed on
the point of a violent outburst. Then he made an
effort and curbed himself. Forcing his voice
down, he spoke slowly and with apparent calmness,
which did not deceive Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s quite right, Merriwell. You fooled me
at the time, but I’ve been thinking it over since
then, and I’ve seen how you jockeyed me out of
that election. Naturally, it looked like anything
but gentleman’s work.”</p>

<p>Chip flushed a little.</p>

<p>“I think you’ve made a big mistake, old man,”
he returned. “I thought you understood me better<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
than that, and I can’t see how you imagine that
I didn’t play fair.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you did, from your viewpoint. You
kept Clancy and Billy Mac out of the game and
smashed up the team. Then, when I was beaten,
you sailed on the field, slapped the team together,
and won out. That’s why you got elected. I’d
have won with the whole team behind me, and
you know it!”</p>

<p>“Keep your temper,” Chip said crisply.
“You’re away off, Bob. I was kidnaped, and
those two fellows pulled me out. If you’d won
the game I’d have been the first to congratulate
you. As it was, I had already proposed you for
captain, if you’ll believe it.”</p>

<p>“You had?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Ask Coach Trayne or any of the fellows.
I don’t think you’ve given me a square deal
in this, Bob, and yet I can see how you look at
it. I’m sorry that I didn’t come to you before and
have it out frankly, but I’ve been pretty busy,
and didn’t understand just what was behind it
all.”</p>

<p>Randall was not at all convinced. He stared
down at the table, and his eye fell on a tiny
folded paper inserted in his Cicero. His cheeks
flushed a trifle, and he gave an imperceptible
start.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he said slowly, his clenched
hands at his sides in self-repression, “I&mdash;I may<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
have been wrong. But it seemed to me that you
hadn’t been the one to hand out a square deal,
Merry. I was helpless in trying to fight you for
an elective office. Everybody around here seems
to toady to the Merriwells&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on, right there, Bob,” Chip interrupted
quickly, his eyes flashing with a hint of anger.</p>

<p>“You know that’s not the case. If there’s any
one who hates to be truckled to and toadied to,
I’m the one. I didn’t go after the captaincy, in
this particular instance, and it was handed to me
before I knew it. As to toadying, you ought to
know the fellows too well to lay that charge,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you everything your own way?” demanded
Randall. His eyes still held to that
folded scrap of paper, and his face looked troubled.
“You run everything around here, and nobody
else gets a look-in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Old man, for Heaven’s sake get your brain
untangled!” Chip leaned forward earnestly, setting
aside his own irritation. “I don’t want to
run anything. Whatever I have done has been
done for Fardale, and I’ve had nothing further
in view than the best good of the school. Let me
prove this by something which I ought not to tell
you.”</p>

<p>He found Randall staring at him with a peculiar
look, and fancied that his words were bearing
fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>“I was just talking to Coach Trayne about who
will be elected captain if I have to leave school&mdash;which
may be at any minute now. I urged you
for the place, since I honestly believe that you’re
the man for it. He could not understand why I
overlooked the way you have acted lately, until I
explained that I hoped to talk it over with you
and straighten things out for the good of Fardale.
I don’t care a whoop about myself, Randall.
I’m only thinking of the school, and I want
you to do the same. Now, slip into your things
and come over to the gym with me. The fellows
will know that the hatchet’s been buried, and you
will leap up at a bound in their estimation, and
everybody will be happy. Will you do it, old fellow?”</p>

<p>Randall had turned, and was gazing out of the
window. Merriwell could not see the dark flush
of anger that flitted across his face, but after a
moment he heard the low and tense voice of Randall.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, Chip. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Randall turned quickly to the closet and pulled
out his shoes, for he had been at work in bath
robe and slippers.</p>

<p>“Good!” Frank cried, in delight. “Get on your
duds, and we’ll forget it all!”</p>

<p>He walked over to the window, looking out on
the campus, and stood watching the flitting crowd
below. Randall had come around all right, he<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
thought, and, with a little careful handling, would
soon be his old self.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, Randall had given a quick
glance at his back. A crafty smile leaped to his
face, and, while still watching Merriwell’s motionless
figure, he reached out and seized the
folded paper.</p>

<p>Tearing off one end with a quick motion, he
emptied a flickering white powder into the glass
that stood beside the pitcher. Still covertly eying
Chip, he deftly obtained a second glass from the
closet shelf and placed it on the opposite side of
the pitcher. Then he poured water into both
glasses.</p>

<p>The white powder dissolved instantly. At the
sound of the pouring water, Merry turned, and
Randall straightened up with a smile that set
queerly on his features.</p>

<p>“I say, Merry,” he called, with seeming candor,
“let’s drink a toast to the success of the
team to-day, and the continuance of our friendship&mdash;a
toast in aqua pura!”</p>

<p>“Bully!”</p>

<p>Merriwell stepped forward, with a smile. At
this instant there was a sudden interruption, however.</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and a panting cadet
orderly appeared as the startled Randall swung
round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[251]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Randall! Colonel Gunn wants to see you
at once in his office.”</p>

<p>This summons could mean only one thing&mdash;trouble.
Randall had already slipped into his
clothes, and he seized his hat, instantly forgetting
everything else. Was it possible that his
visit to the village of the previous night had been
discovered?</p>

<p>“Wait for me, Merry,” he said hastily. “I’ll
probably be right back!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be here, old man,” Chip assured him, and
Randall left hurriedly with the orderly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHO GOT IT?</span></h2>


<p>“Too bad we didn’t drink that toast!” murmured
Merriwell, as the echoing steps of the orderly
and Randall died away down the corridor.
“Still, I’m mighty glad that Bob saw fit to come
around. It’ll clear things up wonderfully.”</p>

<p>He crossed the room and sank into a chair.
Picking up a magazine, he began to turn over its
pages. As he did so, his hand went out to the
nearer of the two glasses, and he brought it to
his lips, sipping slowly.</p>

<p>With a sigh, he emptied the glass and replaced
it on the table. Five minutes passed, and Merry
flung the magazine back to its place, rising.</p>

<p>“Wonder what kind of a row Randall has got
himself into now?” he mused, going to the window
and looking down on the campus, with a
frown.</p>

<p>Colonel Gunn was the principal of Fardale, and
if Randall had been in some kind of a scrape, it
might injure his chances on the diamond. However,
there was a chance that the Southerner had
been guilty of some infraction of the military routine
of the school which would merely get him a
“call-down” and a few black marks.</p>

<p>Suddenly Chip turned, as a sharp knock
sounded at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>“Come in!”</p>

<p>The door opened. Merry gave a gasp of astonishment,
for framed in the doorway, stood Bully
Carson. The latter turned and shut the door,
not observing him.</p>

<p>“You came over to see the game?” Merry
asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>Bully whirled with a swift cry, his face black.</p>

<p>“You! Why&mdash;why&mdash;where’s Bob Randall?
Isn’t this his room?”</p>

<p>The startled surprise of Colonel Carson’s son
was quite evident. In fact, he was wildly disconcerted.
He had expected to see his cousin, and instead
he found Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Don’t get scared out, Bully,” said Chip. “Bob
will be right back. I was waiting for him myself,
so I hope you won’t mind my company.”</p>

<p>Merry thoroughly enjoyed the confusion of the
other. He bore Carson no malice, for he knew
that the other had been thoroughly punished for
his wrongdoings. He fancied that Bully’s confusion
sprang from fear at being found in Fardale&mdash;fear
of new retribution for the past.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he urged pleasantly. “Sit down
and rest your eye, Bully. One of ’em looks pretty
tired. Hot day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Bully growled out something inarticulate and
sank into a chair with a scowl at Merry. Since
he had blundered into it, he was determined to
stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span></p>

<p>As Chip remarked, it was a warm day for that
time of year, and no mistake. Bully Carson was
heated by his walk from the village, and he was
perspiring profusely. He pulled out a handkerchief
of purple silk with red bars, and mopped
at his face, eying Merry furtively. Seeming to
conclude that he was safe for the present, he regained
his composure slowly.</p>

<p>Chip knew that Carson was a thorough bully
and coward. In fact, he had himself presented
Bully with that black eye, when the other had attempted
to “beat him up” in Carsonville the previous
Saturday. He scanned Bully’s attire with
a humorous twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You ought to be more careful, Bully,” he remarked,
with mock solicitude. “If you were seen
on the Fardale streets in those duds, you’d be in
danger of arrest.”</p>

<p>“Huh? What for?” Bully growled suspiciously.
He looked down at himself.</p>

<p>“For disturbing the peace,” said Chip, with a
laugh, dropping on the window seat.</p>

<p>“Think you’re cussed smart, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” Chip gravely assured him.
He found Bully capital amusement. “I only wonder
at your nerve in coming here!”</p>

<p>“You should worry,” retorted Bully, with a
scowl. “Ain’t I got a right to visit my cousin?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Only, if you had another cousin in jail,<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
you’d have a better right to visit him, seems to
me.”</p>

<p>“Huh?” Carson turned pale and mopped at
his face again. “What you goin’ to do about it?”</p>

<p>Chip knew that he could have both Bully and
his father arrested for what had taken place at
Carsonville. This, however, was far from his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Make yourself right at home, old
man. Only I wouldn’t advise you to light up that
cigarette in here.”</p>

<p>Bully had started to roll a cigarette. He
paused, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It’s not allowed. Go ahead and suck it all you
want to, but don’t light it. We don’t approve of
coffin nails at Fardale, and if the guards smelled
smoke they’d throw you out of here in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Carson grunted. Nevertheless, he apparently
decided to take Chip’s warning in good part.
There was an undernote to Merry’s voice that
told him the other was not joking this time.</p>

<p>He finished rolling the cigarette, licked it, and
carefully inserted it into one corner of his mouth.
Then he lolled back in his chair, glanced around,
and favored Chip with a black look.</p>

<p>“You fellers are goin’ to get the hide licked
off you to-day,” he announced. His confidence
was returning, as Merry made no hostile move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks for the news,” said Chip easily. “Are
you going to pitch?”</p>

<p>“No. We got a new feller named Green. He’ll
show you dubs what real pitchin’ is, and I’m goin’
to back him to the limit.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’ll show us more than you did,” and
Frank settled himself among the pillows in the
window seat. “We’re always willing to be
shown, Bully.”</p>

<p>Bully grunted.</p>

<p>“You get yours to-day, all right.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Green?” asked Chip curiously. “Is he
an amateur?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“And I suppose your father is going to bet on
him, as usual?”</p>

<p>Bully grinned, and patted his pocket knowingly.</p>

<p>“Pop’s goin’ to do a little betting, I reckon.
So’m I.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you bet on Fardale, for a change?”
Merry queried pleasantly. “It might get you
something, old man!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you think I’m a piker, hey?” scowled
Bully. “I suppose you think I ain’t got money
myself?”</p>

<p>“You always were good at supposing,” said
Chip. “This time you hit it dead right.”</p>

<p>“That shows how much you know! I got a
thousand dollars in cash, right here in my pocket,<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
and I’m goin’ to meet a feller now and bet on the
Clippers, see?”</p>

<p>Chip was somewhat amazed at this intelligence,
though he gave no sign of it. He knew that Colonel
Carson himself was a heavy plunger, but from
what he had seen of Bully he had not thought
that the latter was exactly flush with money.</p>

<p>“You must have bet on Fardale during that
Franklin game,” he murmured gently. “Or has
your respected father become generous?”</p>

<p>“None o’ your business,” said Bully, with a
growl, finding the subject abruptly distasteful.
“Whew! I’m certainly het up. I guess I’ll run
along and place that bet, then come back here
and find Bob.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourself,” chirped Merry. “If you’re
warm, take a glass of water. When you get outside,
light that cigarette. Then you’ll get nice and
warm again, and it’ll fur up your tongue.”</p>

<p>Bully merely grunted at this sarcasm. He
seemed to decide that part of the advice was good,
however, for he caught up the other glass that
Randall had filled and carried it across the table
to his lips.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll pitch to-day?” he inquired,
pausing.</p>

<p>“Once more your suppositions are correct,” returned
Chip ironically.</p>

<p>Bully grunted and gulped down the water, replacing<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
the glass on the table with a deep sigh,
then threw his sleeve across his lips.</p>

<p>“That certainly tastes good! Well, I hope
you’ll get pounded out of the box, Merriwell.
Green will shut you fellers out without a hit.”</p>

<p>With this pleasant wish Bully came to his feet
and moved toward the door, inspecting a few pictures
and pennants as he went.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry,” pleaded Chip, with mock anxiety.
“You’re not going to tear yourself away so
soon, I trust?”</p>

<p>“Tell Bob I’ll be back later,” said Bully, with
a grunt.</p>

<p>“With pleasure. Maybe you’d like to have me
throw the game for you to-day?”</p>

<p>Carson merely scowled and passed outside,
slamming the door viciously after him. From
the window Frank could see him start across the
campus in the direction of the riding hall, stopping
to light his cigarette.</p>

<p>“Big brute!” he thought, disgusted. “I wonder
how Randall ever got a cousin like that? But&mdash;what
on earth is he doing here? If he and
Bob are getting thick, I feel sorry for Bob.”</p>

<p>This thought was disquieting to Merry. Could
it be possible that Carson was back of Randall’s
queer actions?</p>

<p>It seemed improbable, for Randall had been
keeping to himself, and Carson had not been seen
at Fardale previous to this. Yet Frank knew that<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
Bully possessed a crafty and cunning mind. He
felt disturbed over Carson’s impudence in daring
to show himself about the place.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess Randall can take care of
himself,” he mused, and dismissed the subject
lightly, and settled himself among the pillows
again.</p>

<p>He had been up early that morning, and it was
a warm spring day. Consequently, it was only
natural that he should feel drowsy. Taking advantage
of the moment to relax utterly, Merry
put back his head and closed his eyes. Almost
before he knew it, he had dropped off into a light
doze.</p>

<p>He was roused by a sharp knock at the door,
and sprang up instantly with a shout to enter.
The door swung back and disclosed Colonel
Gunn’s orderly.</p>

<p>“You’re wanted at the office, Mr. Merriwell,”
said the cadet, with symptoms of flurried haste.
“Colonel Gunn sent me after you on the run.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” queried Frank, in surprise. “Is
Randall in trouble?”</p>

<p>“In up to his neck,” said the cadet. “But I’d
better not say anything about it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and Merry seized his hat. “Come
along!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ACCUSED OF THEFT.</span></h2>


<p>Colonel Gunn was fat, ponderous, and highly
dignified. He owned his military title by virtue
of having been an aid on the governor’s staff, but
none the less he was an extremely capable man.</p>

<p>Merry had no inkling of what trouble Randall
was mixed up in, for the orderly had wisely refrained
from discussing it. Upon entering the
office of the principal, Chip found Colonel Gunn
seated at his desk. Before him was Randall,
white-faced and evidently badly frightened,
while at one side stood the constable from Fardale
village.</p>

<p>To judge by the general air of things, the situation
was anything but pleasant for Bob Randall.
Merry came to attention.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Merriwell,” exclaimed the colonel, in
his ponderous style, “I sent for you at&mdash;ah&mdash;Mr.
Randall’s request. There is a considerable&mdash;ah&mdash;difficulty,
and Mr. Randall seems to think that
you can&mdash;ah&mdash;help matters out. I’m sure I hope
so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” returned Frank, quite in the dark
as yet. “I didn’t know that Randall was in any
trouble, sir.”</p>

<p>“I did not intend to convey that&mdash;ah&mdash;intelligence,<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
Merriwell. I merely ventured the&mdash;ah&mdash;statement
that there was a difficulty. You will
please note that there is not only a technical, but
a moral, difference&mdash;I might say a tremendous
difference&mdash;between leveling an accusation of&mdash;ah&mdash;guilt,
or presupposing such a conclusion, and
making a statement of bare and unvarnished
fact.”</p>

<p>Merry was tempted to smile, but knew better.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he gravely answered. “I beg your
pardon, Colonel Gunn, for having unintentionally
miscomprehended your prior remark. If I may
be allowed a word with Randall, sir, it might
serve to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;certainly, certainly!” wheezed the
colonel.</p>

<p>Merry turned. Until then, Randall had not
dared to break silence, knowing that the principal
was a stickler for discipline. Now he
leaned over the table toward Frank, his face
white and tense.</p>

<p>“Chip, I swear that I didn’t do it!” he cried
passionately. “I never dreamed of such a thing!”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” returned Frank, his eyes twinkling.
Then, noting the terrible strain that Randall
labored under, he became serious. “What
is it, old man? What kind of trouble are you
in?”</p>

<p>“This heah officeh says that I stole a thousand<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
dollahs last night!” cried out Randall, indicating
the constable.</p>

<p>Merry smiled. To any one who knew Bob
Randall, the preposterous absurdity of such a
charge was evident. Randall might be a murderer,
but never a thief.</p>

<p>“Why, old man,” said Frank, “surely there’s
no evidence for such a charge? You have plenty
of money, for one thing. For another, any one
who knows you must believe you incapable of
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ sho’ ahe true blue, Chip!” Randall cried
eagerly. “Of co’se, no one would accuse a Randall
of theft, except a low-down Yankee&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Colonel Gunn cleared his throat heavily. His
face looked troubled, and Chip saw that he also
found it hard to reconcile the charge with Randall’s
character.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;ah&mdash;are presupposing a good deal, gentlemen,”
he declared ponderously. “In the first
place, allow me to make the assertion that&mdash;ah&mdash;no
one has accused Mr. Randall of the theft. Is
that not right, constable?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the perplexed officer. “I didn’t
accuse him, exactly. I only wanted to know how
much he knew.”</p>

<p>“A distinction with a difference,” said the
colonel.</p>

<p>Frank made a grimace of despair. If he was<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
going to get to the bottom of this before time
for mess, he would have to wade in.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” he exclaimed, “but I know
nothing of the circumstances referred to. I don’t
see how I can help Randall, but if you’ll be good
enough to explain the nature of the difficulty I’ll
be only too glad to tell anything I know, or to do
anything I can to help out matters.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;quite so, quite so, Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Colonel Gunn swung around in his chair, taking
a paper from the desk before him, and proceeded
to elucidate.</p>

<p>“Putting up at the Dobbs Hotel in the village,
Merriwell, is a gentleman named&mdash;ah&mdash;Hostetter,
Ezra Hostetter. It is his assertion that at
some time last night, some person or persons unknown
did feloniously gain admittance to his
room at the hotel, and did&mdash;ah&mdash;remove from
beneath his pillow a black leather wallet, containing&mdash;ah&mdash;certain
papers. The wallet also contained
a thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills.”</p>

<p>“He must have been pining for adventure, sir,
to carry that much around with him in currency,”
observed Frank. The colonel’s mouth twitched
slightly. “But if the thieves are unknown, where
does Randall come in? He was in barracks last
night, as would be easy to prove.”</p>

<p>“That is just the&mdash;ah&mdash;difficulty,” observed
the colonel heavily, fixing his eye on Randall.
“According to the inspector’s report, Mr. Randall<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
and his roommate were asleep at the proper
time. But when I asked Mr. Randall whether
he had been to the village last night, he admitted
it. Is not that correct, sir?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Colonel Gunn,” said the Southerner
proudly. “There was a dummy in my bed
to fool the inspector. But when you asked, of
course, I would not lie about it, sir.”</p>

<p>“A highly proper&mdash;ah&mdash;sentiment, Mr. Randall,”
said the colonel. He stopped Merry with
uplifted hand. “One moment, sir! Mr. Randall
was seen to enter the hotel in question, and to
leave, each time by the back door, and in a
stealthy manner. When I asked him for an explanation,
he&mdash;ah&mdash;asked that you be sent for.”</p>

<p>Merry looked at the Southerner in astonishment.
Randall stood erect, a dark flush in his
cheeks, his eyes desperate. But he had regained
his self-control.</p>

<p>“I was frightened, Chip,” he said quietly. “Of
course, you know nothing about it, only the evidence
seemed so terribly circumstantial that you
were the first person I thought of.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did think of me, old man,” said
Chip, smiling. “But let’s get this business
straightened out. May I ask who observed Randall’s
entry and departure, Colonel Gunn?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dobbs himself,” stated the colonel, referring
to his paper. “But allow me to&mdash;ah&mdash;mention<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
that Mr. Randall makes no denial, and
no explanation.”</p>

<p>Frank glanced again at Randall, in perplexity.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer, old man?”</p>

<p>“I received a letter from my cousin, Edward
Carson, the son of Colonel Carson, of Carsonville,”
said Randall. “He asked me to meet him
at the hotel on important business. I was unable
to get away before taps, so I left my room by
means of a rope, and entered the hotel quietly,
hoping to avoid observation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Randall,” wheezed the colonel, “and
what, may I inquire, was the nature of the&mdash;ah&mdash;important
business to which your cousin referred?”</p>

<p>“I must refuse to answer, sir,” and Randall
suddenly went white. “I give you my word, sir,
that it was entirely personal and private. More
than that, I cannot say.”</p>

<p>A little silence ensued. Frank studied Randall,
but could find no trace of guilt in the dark,
handsome features. Nor did he believe the
Southerner guilty.</p>

<p>“You know nothing of the theft, of course?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Chip.”</p>

<p>“I must say, colonel,” exclaimed Frank, turning
to the principal, “that I do not think Randall
at all guilty. He could have easily lied out of
the whole thing, and the inspector’s report would<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
have borne him out. The fact that he refused to
do so must surely count in his favor?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly, Merriwell. It has just&mdash;ah&mdash;occurred
to me that if we could locate this Carson,
we might thus exonerate Mr. Randall completely.
Such a consummation would be&mdash;ah&mdash;highly
pleasing to me.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t at the village,” spoke up the constable.
“Mr. Hostetter was lookin’ fer him,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Hostetter knew him, then?” inquired Chip
quickly.</p>

<p>“They was friends,” replied the constable.
Frank turned.</p>

<p>“Carson was at Randall’s room just before I
left, Colonel Gunn. He departed across the
campus, and he might be easily located, I think.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;by all means!”</p>

<p>The principal hastily summoned his orderly
and ordered a dozen cadets dispatched in search
of Carson, who could be easily recognized by
means of his black eye and patch. Randall was
looking at the floor, a tumult of emotions in his
face.</p>

<p>How much Merry knew of the attempt to drug
him, he could not guess. Yet Frank was doing
his best to help him out of his scrape. The
Southerner was smitten with remorse and self-condemnation,
but dared say nothing.</p>

<p>“We’ll clear you, old man,” said Merry<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
warmly. “This might be a plot to ruin your character&mdash;and
knowing Carson, as I do, I would not
put it past him.”</p>

<p>He briefly recounted to Colonel Gunn his late
experiences at Carsonville. The principal, however,
did not agree that there could be any plot
against Randall, and Frank himself had only
suggested it as a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>“Your anxiety for your friend&mdash;ah&mdash;does you
honor, Merriwell. Yet I would point out that
until Mr. Dobbs volunteered his&mdash;ah&mdash;information,
Mr. Randall was not thought of in connection
with the unfortunate matter.”</p>

<p>Poor Randall was miserable enough, and
looked it. He could not doubt Frank’s sincerity
in helping him, and his conscience smote him.
He wondered whether Merry had drank that
glass of water, but Frank gave no signs of being
drugged.</p>

<p>Going over the facts once more, Merriwell was
forced to admit that things looked black for Randall.
If he should be arrested and brought before
a jury, there was little doubt but that he
would be convicted on circumstantial evidence.
And yet it was incredible that he should have
stolen the money!</p>

<p>One by one the searchers brought back word
that there was no sign of Carson anywhere about
the grounds, and on telephoning the hotel, Colonel
Gunn found that he had not returned. Randall’s<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
entire hopes of vindication rested upon his
cousin.</p>

<p>“I’m sure the constable will be willing that
Randall should remain here in your care, colonel,”
suggested Merry. “Carson is sure to turn
up at the game, and he can be brought over at
once to clear Randall.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the colonel, the constable nodding
assent. “And to express my&mdash;ah&mdash;belief
and confidence in Mr. Randall, he shall sit in my
box during the game!”</p>

<p>Randall tried to thank Merry with his eyes, as
the bugles rang out for mess, but Frank departed
with an uneasy feeling that something was certainly
weighing on the Southerner’s mind. Could
he be guilty by any chance?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A MYSTERY.</span></h2>


<p>There was no doubt that the Clippers were a
drawing card.</p>

<p>Although their team was one of the best in the
Amateur League, the rumor had spread abroad
that it had been largely reconstructed by Colonel
Carson for this game, and the near-by towns
had sent their contingents of fans, in no little expectation.</p>

<p>Fardale field was crowded long before the time
for the game. Before two o’clock the grand
stand was sold out. There was no overflow
crowd, since the long bleachers were full able to
handle every one, but automobiles were parked
by the score at all available points, and it looked
as if ground rules would have to go into effect.</p>

<p>There had been a big shift in the Fardale team,
also. News of this had leaked out, and consequently
both cadets and baseball fans were eager
to see what Captain Merriwell had done in the
way of a shake-up.</p>

<p>Man after man purchased a score card, and
then gazed at it in blank amazement. If he happened
to be a Fardale rooter, the amazement was
tinctured with dismay. If he was a Clipper fan,
he stared at his card in perplexity, and began to
ask questions of the men around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>This was the line-up that caused the crowd so
much confusion:</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="displayinline" style="margin-right:2em">
<span class="smallfont" style="padding-left:1em">FARDALE.</span><br />
Lowe, 3d b.<br />
O’Day, r. f.<br />
Kess, 2d b.<br />
Clancy, 1st b.<br />
Merriwell, p.<br />
Harker, ss.<br />
McQuade, c.<br />
Chester, l. f.<br />
Lang, c. f.
</p>

<p class="displayinline" style="margin-left:2em">
<span class="smallfont" style="padding-left:1em">CLIPPERS.</span><br />
Ironton, ss.<br />
Murray, 2d b.<br />
Green, p.<br />
Smith, 1st b.<br />
Olcott, c.<br />
Johnson, r. f.<br />
Craven, 3d b.<br />
Runge, l. f.<br />
Merrell, c. f.
</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s a queer proposition,” said a Clipper
fan, turning to the man behind him. “Who’s this
fellow Green? And Smith?”</p>

<p>“Search me. All we got left o’ the old Clippers
is short and second.”</p>

<p>Over in the Fardale bleachers there was little
short of a sensation, for Chip’s line-up had not
been made public before the game.</p>

<p>“We’re gone!” groaned one man despairingly.
“With Kess on second and O’Day out in the
field, it’s ‘good night’ for us!”</p>

<p>“Merriwell must be crazy,” exclaimed another.
“That blundering Dutchman can’t hit beans!
And Lowe and Harker switched around, and a
substitute in left field! I wish Ted Crockett had
remained captain, by thunder!”</p>

<p>“Oh, pickles!” scoffed a plebe derisively. “Who<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
left the door open for you to get in? You wait
and see what happens to those Clippers!”</p>

<p>None the less, Fardale was anxious. So were
the Clipper sympathizers. When the time for
practice drew near, the crowd was literally on
its toes, watching for the first sight of the players.
Both teams were an unknown quantity, in
their present shape, and the only comfort remaining
to Fardale was that Merriwell was slated
to pitch. The umpires were two Yale men, specially
obtained for the occasion.</p>

<p>Frank was forced to dismiss his worry over
Bob Randall, as the time for work drew near.
Nothing had been seen of Bully Carson, and
Randall was due to witness the game from the
principal’s box&mdash;partly as a guest, partly under
surveillance. The village constable was somewhere
about the field, hunting for Carson.</p>

<p>Colonel Carson himself was in evidence in the
grand stand, laying as many bets as he could
find Fardale takers. Most of these latter were
out-of-town men, for there were few among the
cadets themselves who cared to do any gambling.
The colonel knew nothing of his son, it appeared,
and had not seen him that day.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard a lot about this Merriwell guy,”
stated a Fardale fan to the world at large. “Has
he got anything?”</p>

<p>“Has he!” A fat man below him turned
around, brandishing a fan in one hand and a pop<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
bottle in the other. “Say, ever see the old Frank
Merriwell pitch?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh, once.”</p>

<p>“Well, the kid is a chip of the old block, take
it from me!”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll not let Colonel Carson slide past
me, then,” and the Fardale rooter took out his
pocketbook.</p>

<p>Finally a tremendous burst of cheering started
in the bleachers and gradually spread around the
field. The two teams had arrived for practice
work! Every head was craned to look, and a
howl of expectation rose as the Clippers took the
field first.</p>

<p>The howl rose to a roar of applause as the ball
began to whip around. The new Clipper infield
was a wonder! Their precision was magnificent,
and the way they put the sphere to the bases made
Fardale gasp.</p>

<p>With Coach Trayne, Merry stood watching
them work. Off to one side, Green was limbering
up with his catcher, Olcott. He was a tall, slender,
wiry man with a very brown face and terrific
speed to his practice ball.</p>

<p>“Chip, that fellow is a tartar!” murmured the
coach. “Watch how easily he puts those sizzlers
down, eh? He moves as if every muscle was run
by clockwork!”</p>

<p>“He certainly is a beautiful pitcher,” Frank
said admiringly. “And look there&mdash;see that fellow<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
Craven pick up that hot one! Ironton and
Murray are the only infielders left from their old
team, but I guess Colonel Carson knew his business!”</p>

<p>Wild cheers went up as Craven picked a sizzler
from the ground, darted to his base, and sent the
ball across to third like a bullet. Just then a bat
boy touched Merry’s arm.</p>

<p>“A man in one of the boxes wants to speak to
you, Chip.”</p>

<p>Frank followed his guide back to the grand
stand. A keen-eyed man with a long black cigar
in his mouth was standing by the netting, and
beckoned.</p>

<p>“You wanted me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Say, Merriwell, do you know that fellow
Green&mdash;the Clippers’ pitcher?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” returned Chip, smiling. “He looks
mighty good, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m a traveling man, but I’m rooting for
Fardale. Did you ever hear of Southpaw
Diggs?”</p>

<p>“Often. He’s one of the best pitchers in the
country, if he’d let booze alone. What’s on your
mind?”</p>

<p>“That fellow Green is a dead ringer for Diggs,
Merriwell! He ain’t got Diggs’ big rainbow
mustache, but I’ve seen Diggs work too often not
to recognize that wind-up.”</p>

<p>Frank looked up at the man, startled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>

<p>“Impossible, my friend! The Clippers are all
amateurs&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats! I know too much about the game
to swallow that talk, Merriwell, especially when
Colonel Carson talks it.”</p>

<p>Merry looked troubled. He knew Carson was
crooked as a corkscrew, but it was incredible that
such a barefaced thing could be attempted.</p>

<p>“If you can swear that Diggs and Green are
one and the same,” suggested Frank, frowning,
“we could protest him.”</p>

<p>“No,” returned the traveling man regretfully.
“I never seen Diggs close up, but I could recognize
that wind-up a mile away. I couldn’t swear
to it very well, though.”</p>

<p>“Then the game has to go on,” said Frank.</p>

<p>At this point the man next to his informant,
who had been listening, chipped in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Old man Carson is betting all kinds of money,
Merriwell. If that fellow is really Diggs, would
it queer the bets?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said Merry. “If we could prove
it, of course, the bets would be off, and so would
the game. But I see no chance of proving it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m backin’ your crowd,” went on the
man anxiously. “I had a bet at even money with
the colonel’s son, but he must have got cold feet.
He ain’t showed up.”</p>

<p>“Was it much of a bet?” asked Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[275]</span></p>

<p>“A thousand even.”</p>

<p>“You’d better keep your money in your pocket,”
advised Chip, turning away. “Betting is mighty
poor business, especially where the Carson crowd
is mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>He stood looking across the field, suddenly
thoughtful. A thousand dollars&mdash;and Bully Carson
also had boasted that he had a thousand in
cash to bet&mdash;and Hostetter had been robbed of
exactly that amount!</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty queer coincidence,” reflected
Merry, worried. “Hostetter and Bully were
friends, according to Colonel Gunn. Could it be
possible that Carson did steal that money? But
where is he now?”</p>

<p>That was a mystery. Evidently Bully had
failed to meet the man with whom he was to bet,
yet he had left Randall’s room for that express
purpose.</p>

<p>“I believe he can explain that theft,” muttered
Frank. “And I’ll make it my business to find
him after the game.”</p>

<p>Returning to Coach Trayne, he repeated the
information given him by the traveling man, and
Trayne watched Green closely.</p>

<p>“He does resemble Diggs in general outline,”
admitted the coach. “And his wind-up and delivery
are exactly similar. Chip, I’ve a good notion
to stop this game now!”</p>

<p>“You’ve no proof, Mr. Trayne. The Clippers<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
are vouched for as amateurs by their owner, and
even if he has put in a few ringers, that can’t hurt
our standing, if we play them. And it would be
a bad business to start something we can’t finish.”</p>

<p>Trayne saw the justice of this argument, and
Merry caught up his glove, as the bell rang, and
ran out. While he was warming up with Billy
Mac, the other Fardale men began to work, and
Merry’s judgment was soon vindicated by the
fans, except in the case of Villum Kess.</p>

<p>The Dutch lad seemed awkward. He committed
no glaring errors, but it seemed to the crowd
that any one would have been better at second
than he. However, Fardale was now committed,
and every rooter hoped for the best as
the Fardale yell began to ring out: “Ha, ha, ha!
’Rah, ’rah, ’rah! Rigger-boom! Zigger-boom!
All hail&mdash;Fardale! Fardale! Fardale!”</p>

<p>The Clipper sympathizers had no regular yell,
but they made good with a thunder of feet stamping,
and a roar of shouts and yells. For an instant
these fell silent while the two umpires announced
the batteries, then they rose again into
a wild storm as the Fardale nine trotted out and
took the field.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” cried the strike umpire, adjusting
his mask. Ironton stepped out.</p>

<p>The game was on.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.</span></h2>


<p>“Ve vos all pehind you, Chip!” squawked Villum
Kess, capering around second.</p>

<p>“Take your time, old man,” advised Clancy.</p>

<p>“Let this boob hit it,” grinned Billy Mac, as
Ironton stepped into the box.</p>

<p>Frank paused. He had seen clearly that Green
was a whirlwind, and decided to hold his best
ball, the jump, in reserve. If Green was really
Diggs, then he had his work cut out for him.</p>

<p>“Get on to that guy on second!” yelled a fan.</p>

<p>Villum Kess had come to rest plumb on his
bag, and stood waiting.</p>

<p>“Play off there, you lobster!” shrieked another
rooter frantically.</p>

<p>“Blay off yourselluf,” returned Villum hotly.
“Shud oop und say less. Make a glam of yourselluf
if I vas a lopster yes, no! Yaw! You vait
till you show me!”</p>

<p>Frank nodded to Billy, and put over a low,
straight ball. Ironton waited.</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;one!”</p>

<p>The Clipper shortstop was a wicked hitter, as
Merry knew. Seeing that he stood up close to the
plate, Chip put over a sharp inshoot, and again
the umpire called a strike, as Ironton swung
vainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>He refused to bite at two teasers, however,
and again Merry used his in. As if sensing the
ball, Ironton pulled back and chopped.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Merry reached after the hot liner in vain. It
went straight toward the position that Kess
should have been playing, while Ironton dug
down toward first, amid wild whoops from the
bleachers. Then Villum did a surprising thing.</p>

<p>Flinging himself out toward the ball, he lost
his balance and slid forward, whirling around.
He came down in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“By glory, he sat on it!” yelled the fans.</p>

<p>Villum reached beneath himself and pulled out
the ball, staring at it in mild astonishment.</p>

<p>“Put it over, you boob!” shrieked Clancy.</p>

<p>Kess looked up, saw the runner nearing first,
and scrambled to his feet. With astonishing precision,
he sent the ball to Clancy, and the umpire
motioned Ironton out.</p>

<p>“It was an accident!” cried Craven, on the
coaching line. “He’s an idiot!”</p>

<p>“Go avay mit yourselluf!” squawked Villum,
brushing the dust from his shirt. “Vait till I vos
shown you how you don’d blay, yes, no!”</p>

<p>Murray advanced to the plate, and with evident
determination to hit. After trying to connect
with three sharp curves, Murray slung away
his bat and yielded up his place to Green.</p>

<p>Frank saw the wiry pitcher pull down his cap<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
and dust his hands, and the quiet confidence of
the man went far to show that he was no amateur.
Grimly resolving to fan him, Chip wound
up for the double shoot, and the ball hummed
down.</p>

<p>Green did not attempt to strike. Then a swift
look of astonishment overspread his lean brown
face. Merry had changed from his right to his
left hand!</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” gasped Green. “It’s impossible!”</p>

<p>“Go on and knock it over the fence,” chuckled
Billy Mac.</p>

<p>Green tried to, but the double shoot fooled him
completely. With a smile, Frank delivered a
sharp out with his left hand, and Green reached
for it in vain.</p>

<p>“We’ve got ’em!” whooped Clancy as he ran
in. “One, two, three!”</p>

<p>“Easy money,” cried Billy, and Chip touched
his cap to the yelling grand stand as the Fardale
cheer ripped out.</p>

<p>Fardale’s hopes received an abrupt shock, however.
Smiling a little, but saying nothing, Green
put over nine pitched balls, and retired Lowe,
O’Day, and Kess!</p>

<p>“He can’t pitch anything but strikes!” gasped
Clancy.</p>

<p>“Don’d you see dot sbeed!” muttered Villum.
“Dot pall a pullet vos, so hellup me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[280]</span></p>

<p>“We’re up against something pretty hard, fellows,”
said Chip, as they went out. “Everybody
pull together, now, and we’ll win.”</p>

<p>His confidence had been sorely shaken, however.
Smith strode out and landed on Frank’s
first ball for a foul that went up over the grand
stand. Twice more he fouled, but the double
shoot retired him finally.</p>

<p>“They’re all bad actors,” cried Lowe from
third. “Let ’em hit it, Chip!”</p>

<p>Olcott, the new Clipper catcher, was a short
man, with tremendously wide shoulders. Chip
tried him with a low fadeaway, but Olcott chortled
with glee and fell on it. The ball rose and
began to travel for the right-field fence.</p>

<p>O’Day raced back, then stopped short. The
crowd hooted, for the ball seemed certain to go
far beyond him. The fans had forgotten the
wind, however, and, when the sphere came down
it nestled into O’Day’s glove, and stuck there.
Johnson fanned, and the Fardales went to bat.</p>

<p>That is, they went to bat technically. Clancy
was the first up, and although usually a slugger,
he was retired on three pitched balls. Merry
took his place, with the bleachers screaming for
a hit.</p>

<p>Green studied him a moment, then changed his
position abruptly. He used something that he
had hitherto held in reserve&mdash;a remarkable spit
ball. Frank guessed it, but could not hit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>Again Green used the same thing, and again
Merry missed it. He touched the third one for a
high foul, however, that cleared the grand stand.
With a new ball thrown out to him, Green deliberately
put over three balls that were wide of
the plate.</p>

<p>“Put it over!” snapped Chip. “You’re scared
to put it over, Green!”</p>

<p>Green looked at him, and grinned tantalizingly.
Then he calmly sent over the ball, ten feet wide
of the plate. Frank angrily flung his bat away,
and walked.</p>

<p>The Fardale rooters went wild, but Chip was
not fooled. He knew that this was a deliberate
effort to rattle him, and that Green had meant to
show his contempt. This was proved when Harker
was sent down on three pitched balls, though
Green again held his spit ball under cover.</p>

<p>His curves were wonderful, and would have
fooled better men than Fardale owned. Seeing
that he was marooned on first, Chip made a
desperate attempt, and stole second, but only got
there safely because Murray dropped a terrific
ball, that Olcott placed perfectly. Billy Mac immediately
struck out, and the inning was over.</p>

<p>“That man Green is beyond anything I ever
saw!” cried Coach Trayne, as Chip came in to
confer with Billy. “Watch out for Craven,
Merry!”</p>

<p>Frank nodded toward the bench. Craven was<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
a slender, lanky fellow with a large jaw. He
was chewing tobacco, and carried his bat easily.</p>

<p>Using his right hand once more, Merry resorted
to the double shoot, refusing Billy’s
agonized plea to use the jump ball. Craven
fanned twice, seeming to be awkward at the plate,
but on the third ball he struck too quickly,
whirled, and the ball hit him between the shoulders.</p>

<p>He went down to first, apparently badly hurt.
But Chip caught a quick grin from him, and
realized angrily that the umpire had been
“worked” very neatly. He fanned Merrell, then
Runge, but Craven romped down to second without
hindrance, exchanging compliments with the
enraged Villum, as he did so.</p>

<p>Ironton again was at bat. Chip sent the ball
sizzling over for two strikes, but Ironton had
solved the double shoot. He connected with the
next ball and dropped it over second for a neat
single&mdash;the first hit of the game. Craven went
to third, with the crowd frantic, and Murray
was up.</p>

<p>Chip switched hands in desperation, and Murray
fanned twice. Then Ironton tried for second,
and Billy Mac made a wretched throw that Villum
barely hung on to, a yard from the sack.
When Frank put the ball down again, Murray
cracked a liner at Lowe&mdash;and Lowe fumbled it,
booting it across the infield to Harker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[283]</span></p>

<p>The crowd came to its feet, as Craven raced
over the rubber. Harker lost his head and made
a throw ten feet wide of the plate. Billy went
after it, but Ironton came in like a whirlwind.
Frank ran in and put the ball on him as he slid,
but the umpire called him safe, and the Clippers
had secured two runs, with Murray on third
and Green up.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake use the jump!” implored
Billy desperately, conferring with Chip. But
Merry, grim-lipped, refused.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hold it, Billy. This game is only
three innings old.”</p>

<p>He walked back, determined to retrieve the
errors that had overwhelmed his team. Green
faced him with a wide grin, the Clipper fans
howling for a hit to bring in Murray. And
Green was confident of getting it. Murray’s lone
hit had started things.</p>

<p>Frank did the very last thing Green expected.
With a lengthy preliminary, he sent in a fast
straight ball over the heart of the plate. Green
had watched his fingers, and expected a drop,
striking a foot beneath the ball.</p>

<p>“That got him!” yelled Clancy.</p>

<p>“Another of the same,” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“Sure, give me another,” begged Green.</p>

<p>Chip smiled. He knew that Green would now
be certain of a swift curve. So, making as if<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
to throw an out, Chip sent down another straight
ball.</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;uh&mdash;two!”</p>

<p>“That’s headwork, old man!” cried Harker.</p>

<p>“Led him dood it!” cried Villum. “Ve vos all
behind you, Frankie!”</p>

<p>Merry stood quietly. He refused Billy’s signals
time after time, knowing that Green was
watching him like a hawk, until the crowd yelled
for action. In desperation Billy tried the signal
for another straight ball, and Merry nodded.</p>

<p>Again he wound up carefully. This time he
cut loose with every ounce of speed at his command,
and the ball went down fairly scorching.
Green hit, but hit too late, and Billy was taken off
his feet by the speed of the ball. None the less,
he held on to it; Chip had fanned his rival with
three straight balls!</p>

<p>Not only those in the grand stand, but the
bleachers had also noted the fact, and there was
a deep roar of cheers as Fardale came in. Merry
passed Green, and the latter gave him a quick
smile.</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” he said quietly, “I take off my hat
to you! That was magnificent.”</p>

<p>Chip looked at him, found sincerity in the wrinkled
eyes, and warmed instinctively.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said significantly. “Coming
from you, that means a good deal, Mr. Diggs!”</p>

<p>Green started, gave him one keen glance, then<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
passed on with a laugh. But in that moment
Chip knew that he now knew his man.</p>

<p>“That man is Diggs, right enough,” he said to
Coach Trayne, as his next three men proceeded
to fan. “But he’s not beaten us yet.”</p>

<p>“Yaw!” squawked Villum from behind. “Dot
vos right, Chip! Two runs don’d a pasepall game
make, you pet me! Vait till I dood it!”</p>

<p>For the second time, Green retired Fardale on
nine pitched balls.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE JUMP BALL.</span></h2>


<p>The fourth inning started off badly, Smith
beating out a bunt to first, but he held on while
Merry tightened and fanned the next two men
with the double shoot. At this Smith went down
to second, where Villum was standing on the sack
as usual.</p>

<p>Billy Mac sent down a perfect throw from the
plate, but Villum appeared not to see it, for he
was staring at Smith.</p>

<p>“Jump, you chump!” yelled Smith, and flung
himself down in a beautiful fall-away slide.</p>

<p>For the second time that day, Villum sat down
suddenly. The ball plunged into the cloud of
dust, and a groan from the bleachers. When the
dust cleared off, Villum was seen to be smiling
blandly at Smith, holding the ball against the latter’s
chest; Smith’s leg was hooked about Villum’s
waist, and the Clipper was staring up with
wild astonishment.</p>

<p>“You vas oudt,” exclaimed Villum. “You vos
hooked me aroundt vhere I down sit, und you
thought it vos der pase, yes, no?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m jiggered!” gasped Smith.</p>

<p>The crowd roared with laughter at this evidence
of Villum’s playing, but it fell into somber<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
silence once more as Fardale came to bat
and O’Day struck out.</p>

<p>Then Villum came up to the plate, and, in trying
to hit the first ball over, he lost his balance
and was hit himself. The umpire hesitated, then
motioned him to first, and Olcott’s protest went
unheeded.</p>

<p>“Yaw!” triumphantly blatted the Dutch lad, as
he trotted down. “I toldt you I’d dood it! Britty
soon der ball vill hit Chip a home run vor, you
pet me!”</p>

<p>“Sacrifice, Clan,” ordered Merry quietly. “You
can’t hope for a hit.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Clancy, pausing as he was
going forth.</p>

<p>“Because we’re up against Southpaw Diggs.
Bunt it.”</p>

<p>The red-haired chap tried hard to obey, but
failed. Villum went to second, however. Murray
stood square on the base line, trying to block
him off, and Villum arrived at about the same
time as the ball. He flung himself straight at the
sack and Murray went down amid a cloud of
dust, from which the ball was seen to roll. Instantly
Villum jumped up and went tearing
toward third, regardless of Lowe’s orders to hold
second. Murray pegged the ball down to Craven,
but made a poor throw. It was a close decision,
but Villum got the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>“Bring him in, Chip,” said Clancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>For the second time, Merry faced his rival, and
for the second time Green resorted to his wonderful
spit ball. Once Chip fouled, and once
struck in vain, then at the last instant he choked
his bat and met the third ball for a bunt.</p>

<p>The slippery ball twisted along toward first,
and Merry sped after it like a deer. Green went
for it, but Chip beat out the throw, and Villum
was safe with the first run for Fardale. Harker
fanned, and the inning was ended.</p>

<p>“Well, that showed that they aren’t invulnerable,
fellows,” said Merry cheerfully. “We’ll even
up pretty soon!”</p>

<p>“You’re the only one of us who has a hit so
far,” said Billy Mac.</p>

<p>“And that was a bad scratch,” chuckled Merry.
“Well, go to it!”</p>

<p>Craven, the dangerous third baseman, was
again up. He could not solve the double shoot,
however, and Merrell and Runge went down,
also. Merry had repeated Green’s feat of retiring
the side with nine pitched balls.</p>

<p>As he walked in and met Billy, however, he
shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I’m using that ball too much,” he said, in a
low voice. “I don’t want to use the jump unless
I have to, but I can’t throw the double shoot all
the time, Billy.”</p>

<p>“Change arms, then.”</p>

<p>“I have. Well, let’s see what happens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[289]</span></p>

<p>Billy, Chester, and Lange went down in regular
order to the smiling Green, although Lange
managed to send up a pop fly that was gathered
in by Murray. The sixth started with the heavy
end up, and Ironton came out confidently.</p>

<p>Frank tried to avoid using the double shoot,
with the result that Ironton poled a hot liner
toward third. Lowe made a beautiful stop that
drew an admiring yell from the bleachers, but
dropped the ball, and Ironton beat it out.</p>

<p>The next man up was Murray, and Chip handled
him carefully, forcing him to put up an infield
fly, that Villum easily absorbed. Then
Green strode out, smiling.</p>

<p>Chip gathered every energy. He put over the
double shoot, reversing from an in to an out,
and Green fanned. Then, using his left hand, he
reversed the shoot, and once more Green struck
in vain, Ironton going down to second. Knowing
that it was useless to attempt luring Green, Frank
once more threw every effort into a terrifically
swift, straight ball&mdash;and again Green fanned.</p>

<p>The speed of that ball was too much for Billy,
however. It went through him and rolled back
to the grand stand, while Green tore to first and
Ironton to third. Both were safe, and Smith
advanced to the plate. Frank signaled to Billy to
come up.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, old man,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Chip,” and Billy was almost in<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
tears. “They can’t touch you, and if you only
had a decent catcher&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“None of that,” said Merry. “You’re all right,
Billy. But I daren’t use the double shoot again.
I’ve pitched nothing else, and I can’t give away
the jump ball just yet. I’m going to try the spit
ball, so watch out for bad ones.”</p>

<p>The almost constant use of the double shoot
had been a tremendous strain on Frank’s arm,
and Billy was forced to assent. Merry did not
half like using the spit ball, as he had not practiced
it for some time, but the need was imperative.</p>

<p>In fact, his first two balls went wide of the
plate, and nearly let in a run. Then he found
himself, and Smith fanned twice, Billy vainly
trying to catch Green at second. By sheer good
luck, Smith connected and walloped out a beauty
to the left garden, which Chester gathered. But
Ironton beat the ball to the plate for the third
tally.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” came a voice from the grand
stand that Frank recognized for that of Colonel
Carson. “Knock him out of the lot! He’s
gone!”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you something, you old scoundrel!”
muttered Chip angrily, as Olcott pounded the
rubber and begged for a good one.</p>

<p>He seemed unable to fulfill his prediction, however,
for Olcott bunted the first ball to Harker,<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
the shortstop made a poor throw to first, and Olcott
was safe. Johnson came up, but ended the
inning by popping a foul, that Billy Mac neatly
garnered.</p>

<p>“Four to one,” said Lowe, with a groan, as
they came in. “We’re done!”</p>

<p>“We’re not,” said Clancy warmly. “Chip
hasn’t begun to pitch yet.”</p>

<p>Merry smiled faintly, and stared aghast as
Green again put over nine pitched balls and retired
Fardale. The man seemed made of iron!</p>

<p>In the first half of the seventh it seemed that
only luck saved Fardale. Chester dropped Craven’s
fly, and Merrell let the ball hit him. Runge
fanned, and Ironton came up with second and
third filled, and one out. He knocked a hot one
to Villum, who promptly dropped it; while every
one yelled at him, the Dutch lad stared at the
runners in astonishment.</p>

<p>Then he picked up the ball and slammed it to
third, catching Merrell, and Lowe snapped it to
Billy for a double play that retired the Clippers.</p>

<p>“Get a hit, Clan,” said Merry quietly. “Green’s
weakening.”</p>

<p>Clancy brightened up perceptibly, and though
Green showed no sign of weakening, Clancy was
hit by the ball, and went to first. Merry came up,
made a quick guess that Green would give him an
in, and swung with all his strength. He hit the
ball on the nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>“Wow!”</p>

<p>A shrill yell went up from every fan as the ball
sailed out, cleared the fence, and was no more
seen. As Merry jogged in from third he grinned.</p>

<p>“All luck, Green,” he cried.</p>

<p>Frank had netted two runs with that homer,
but the eighth opened with the score four to
three in favor of the Clippers, and Craven at
bat. He grounded out to Clancy, Merrell fanned,
and Runge flied to Lowe. Green again fanned
three men, leaving Kess up, and the ninth inning
was on.</p>

<p>“All right, Billy,” said Chip quietly. “Every
ball a jump.”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” yelled Billy, in delight. “Nine
balls, Merry!”</p>

<p>Ironton was up. Merry put the first ball down
to him right in the groove, and he swung viciously
at it. The ball seemed to leap over his
bat into Billy’s glove.</p>

<p>“Hey!” cried Ironton, amazed. “What’s the
matter with that ball?”</p>

<p>“Take another look,” said Chip, with a grin.</p>

<p>Again he sent it squarely over the plate, and
again Ironton failed utterly to find it. The
third ball looked even better, and with wondering
desperation Ironton brought around his bat.</p>

<p>“Out!”</p>

<p>“What kind of a ball is that?” demanded Ironton
savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[293]</span></p>

<p>“Plain straight ball,” chuckled Billy. “Couldn’t
you see it?”</p>

<p>The grand stand began to appreciate a change
in Merriwell’s pitching as Johnson came into the
box and proceeded to strike out also.</p>

<p>“He’s using a new ball!” yelled the traveling
man who had recognized Green-Diggs.</p>

<p>“Look at Johnson swing!” shrieked another
fan excitedly. “Where’d he get that ball? What
is it?”</p>

<p>Johnson watched the third one come, and tried
helplessly to find it. He was motioned out, and
flung his bat away heatedly.</p>

<p>“There’s some crooked work here!” he cried.</p>

<p>“And it smells like Southpaw Diggs,” chirped
Clancy, as Green came out swinging two bats.
He flung one away and stepped into the box.</p>

<p>The Fardale fans began to pluck up hope.
They roared out hoarse entreaties to fight it out,
and as he glanced at the grand stand Merry saw
Colonel Gunn standing up and excitedly waving
his hat, dignity utterly forgotten, while Randall
clutched him around the neck and yelled like a
crazy man.</p>

<p>“Here’s a nice straight one for you, Green,”
said Chip.</p>

<p>Green evidently believed him, for he swung at
the ball wickedly. But the sphere took a queer
upward jump into Billy’s mitt, and Green stepped
back with a single gasp of amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[294]</span></p>

<p>“What you got on that ball?” he queried wonderingly.</p>

<p>Smiling, Merry sent down another, square in
the groove. This time Green stood back and
watched it, then grinned.</p>

<p>“Let her come!” he cried, and Chip knew that
he had solved the jump.</p>

<p>With that, he sent down a straight ball. Green
grinned again, struck a foot above it&mdash;and was
out!</p>

<p>But the Clippers were still one run to the good.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DESPERATE FINISH.</span></h2>


<p>Fardale field was a pandemonium.</p>

<p>Grand stand and bleachers alike were crazy
with excitement. The band, unheard, blared
forth amid the din. Men shouted and shrieked
for the score to be tied, begged Merry to crack
out another homer, hit each other over the head,
and threatened to smash the stands with their
frenzied stamping.</p>

<p>With suddenness that was almost appalling,
the din died away as Villum Kess was seen walking
out to the plate. The rooters held their
breath.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” groaned a man near Colonel
Gunn’s box. “That dunderhead will be the first
out&mdash;it’s all over.”</p>

<p>“Confound your impertinence, sir!” roared the
irate colonel, twisting about and threatening the
fan with personal violence. “It’s not&mdash;ah&mdash;all
over till the last man has&mdash;ah&mdash;gone down!”</p>

<p>Then he turned and sent another roar at the
field.</p>

<p>“Get a hit! Get a hit!”</p>

<p>The crowd took up the swinging words. “Get
a hit! Get a hit!” rose the thunder of many
voices, pierced by the shrill yells of the Clipper
fans, who implored Green to “Hold ’em down!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[296]</span></p>

<p>Then Kess stepped into the box, and instantly
the silence fell anew.</p>

<p>“Yaw!” squawked the Dutch lad, his voice
sounding distinctly all over the field. “Didn’t I
toldt you I vos goin’ to dood it! You vos a
skinch, so hellup me!”</p>

<p>“You’ll get skinned, all right,” yelled Olcott.
“Let the Dutchman hit it, old man! He’s easy!”</p>

<p>“Shut oop mit your mouth!” retorted Villum,
turning angrily.</p>

<p>As he did so, Green unwound and the sphere
came down like a bullet. Villum tried to strike,
but overreached himself and fell forward, sitting
on the plate.</p>

<p>“Vot der matter vos?” he inquired blankly.
“Vhere vos der pall?”</p>

<p>“Get up or you’ll have another strike called,”
said Olcott.</p>

<p>Villum scrambled to his feet. His actions disgusted
the excited crowd, however, and a storm
of objurgation began to rain upon him.</p>

<p>“Take him out! Send in a ball player!”</p>

<p>“Get the hook! Get the hook!”</p>

<p>“By Yimini, you shoot oop!” roared Villum,
waving his bat at the grand stand. “How vos I
to hear der pall coming vhen you vos making such
a yelling?”</p>

<p>Green smiled and once more put the ball across
while Villum was glaring at the crowd. He
whirled around as the ball plunked home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[297]</span></p>

<p>“Vot vos dot?”</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;two!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>“Vell, by shinks!” gasped Villum angrily.
“You vos der advantage oof me dake, yes, no?”</p>

<p>“Watch out,” advised Olcott, with a wide grin.
“Here it comes again.”</p>

<p>Villum spat on his hands, pounded the plate,
and settled down. Even the nonchalant Green
was laughing, but his laugh ended suddenly.</p>

<p>For, as the ball came glinting down, Villum
gathered together, swung mightily, and connected!</p>

<p>“He’s done it!” shrieked the fans, coming to
their feet with a howl.</p>

<p>The ball went sizzling along the ground to Craven,
while Villum Kess labored toward first. The
third baseman was so astonished at his hit that
when he scooped up the ball he fumbled it. Then
he picked it up again and whipped it to first.</p>

<p>“Look oudt!” yelled Villum. “I vos coming!”</p>

<p>He came, too, in an unheralded slide. Smith,
the semipro, had probably never seen any one
slide for first before in all his life. He was so
startled at the action that he missed the ball,
which went past him.</p>

<p>Instantly Villum gained his feet and plunged
toward second, repeating his bull-head effort of
the fourth inning. While Smith chased the ball
the crowd began to yell encouragement at him,
remembering that he had scored the first tally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[298]</span></p>

<p>On reaching second, Villum took a look over
his shoulder and started for third. Smith had
gained the ball, and was sending it across the diamond
to Craven, but none the less he pounded
on, head down and elbows working.</p>

<p>He was only halfway from second when Craven
picked up the ball and started for him with
a grin. Villum never slacked up, despite the
frantic yells that were directed at him. Just as
Craven reached out to tag him, however, he
stumbled over his own foot and fell like a shot,
headfirst.</p>

<p>He struck squarely against Craven’s knees.
The latter’s hand was distinctly seen to fly out,
while the ball dropped and rolled away. Out of
the whirling arms and legs emerged Villum,
bounced to third, and turned toward home.</p>

<p>“I toldt you I vos a home run got!” he bellowed.</p>

<p>This time, however, this amazing luck seemed
to have deserted him. Craven rolled over and
got the ball, and quickly snapped it home. Olcott
stepped out to get it, flinging aside his mask, and
a groan swelled out from the crowd.</p>

<p>“He’s done for!”</p>

<p>“Nefer!” roared Villum, bouncing along desperately.</p>

<p>Once more he shot to earth, just as the ball
came whizzing along over him. Olcott took the<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
ball and fetched it down, but Villum had already
come to a stop, hands outstretched before him.</p>

<p>“Shudgement!” he squawked at the umpire.
“You pet me dot I vos safe!”</p>

<p>He had the tips of his fingers on the plate&mdash;and
had effected a home run without making a hit!</p>

<p>“Yaw!” he shrieked, in delight. “Vot vos I
toldt you! You pet me der score she vos died,
yes, no?”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Villum,” laughed Chip, escorting
the Dutch lad to the bench in mingled wonder
and joy. “Take off your hat!”</p>

<p>Villum did so, then looked at it curiously. His
eyes went to Chip’s face, then to the grand stand,
and for the first time he seemed to realize that
the crowds were yelling at him in frantic madness.
He bowed, stumbled, stood on his head,
and vanished under the players’ shed.</p>

<p>As Clancy walked out, Green seemed to lose
his composure for the first time.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you boneheads!” he shouted
wrathfully at his amazed team, who were still
trying to find out what had happened. “They’ve
got four runs on us, with only two hits. And
Merriwell got them both! Wake up and play
the game!”</p>

<p>“Here’s where we get another hit, Southpaw
Diggs,” said Clancy merrily, as he danced into
the box. “Put her over, old sox!”</p>

<p>Green obeyed, and the ball had so much speed<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
that Clancy merely leaped backward in actual
terror.</p>

<p>“Hey!” he cried. “You don’t need to kill a
fellow!”</p>

<p>Green smiled, having regained his lost poise,
and brought out his spit ball in this emergency.
Clancy swung at it vainly.</p>

<p>“Strike&mdash;two.”</p>

<p>Once more the ball sped down like a white
streak. This time Clancy connected with a crack
that fetched the crowds up standing. But the
roar was followed by a groan, as the ball lifted
into deep center field and Merrell went after it.</p>

<p>Merrell was more intent on the ball than on
the ground, however. Clancy was running along
to first and watching him when Merrell stumbled
and fell. The ball came down a yard beyond
him, and O’Day sent Clancy on to second, while
once more the roar swelled out from the
bleachers.</p>

<p>“Green’s blown up! Merry to bat!”</p>

<p>“A hit, Merriwell! Get a hit! Get a hit!”</p>

<p>“One run wins the game! Get a hit!”</p>

<p>That fly, which fell well within Merrell’s territory,
and should have been fielded easily, went
as an error instead of a hit. Therefore, in spite
of the fact that Fardale had four runs, Merry
was the only one who had so far been able to hit
Green. One of his two hits was a scratch, and
the other was a lucky jab by his own admission.<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
Therefore, as he came up to the plate, he was
anything but confident.</p>

<p>He had already given Clancy the hit-and-run
signal, for he himself had little hope of making
another decent hit. As he stepped in the box and
faced Green, he saw the man’s lean brown face
smiling at him, and knew that the other was even
cooler than he himself.</p>

<p>For the second time, Green read danger in
Merry’s eyes and resolved to take no chances.
He sent down a wide one, and Chip lashed out
at it in order to give Clancy a chance.</p>

<p>The red-haired chap went to third, safe by a
narrow margin. After that, Green sent down
no more wide ones, but instead he placed them
so high that Olcott was forced to get on his toes
to reach them. Yet they never went too high
for him; Green was a perfect master, and his control
was absolute.</p>

<p>Three of them sang past, while Merry waited
desperately. He knew perfectly well that Green
intended to pass him, in order to strike out the
next three men.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner die fighting than be left at the
post,” he muttered grimly, taking a firm grip on
his bat.</p>

<p>Again Green smiled, scarcely taking the trouble
to wind up for the throw. He sent the ball
down to Olcott, far too high for a good strike, but<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
Chip was past caring whether it was good or
not.</p>

<p>With an effort, he swung up and reached for
it. There was a crack, and the sphere shot out
over second base&mdash;for his third hit off Green!</p>

<p>Merrell made a hard run in for the ball, secured
it on the first bounce, and relayed in a beautiful
throw to Olcott. Clancy was tearing for
home, and he ran along as he had never run before.
Glancing around, he saw the ball almost
even with him, and as he neared home he went
down in a desperate slide.</p>

<p>Olcott received the ball perfectly, and there
was a moment of suspense as the dust rose and
hid the play. Then the umpire’s figure emerged,
hands down.</p>

<p>Fardale had won on Merry’s hit&mdash;the closest
finish ever seen on Fardale field.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CAUGHT WITH THE GOODS.</span></h2>


<p>“It’s Merry’s game, all right!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that, fellows,” said Merry,
as he entered the dressing room and heard Lowe’s
remark; “I’d say that it’s Villum’s game. Didn’t
he get the run that tied, and get it without assistance?”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter went up. As Merry went
to his locker, however, he was approached by
Colonel Gunn’s orderly, who shoved hastily
through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Come outside, Mr. Merriwell!” cried the
cadet. “The constable wants you!”</p>

<p>“Tell him I’ll be dressed in a minute,” returned
Chip.</p>

<p>“No, get a move on right now!” insisted the
other excitedly. “Colonel Gunn is waiting, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s a horse of another color, then,” said
Chip, and made haste outside.</p>

<p>He found the constable, who greeted him
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Say, Merriwell, come along over to the riding
hall. Colonel Gunn’s gone over, and said to bring
you along.”</p>

<p>“Me? What for?”</p>

<p>Merry had forgotten all about the affairs of
Randall in the excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[304]</span></p>

<p>“Why, they found that feller Carson, and he
seems to be drunk, or hurt, or something,” explained
the constable hurriedly, as they started
out. “One o’ the boys phoned over to the grand
stand just before the game ended.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad,” commented Merry. “You don’t
know any more?”</p>

<p>The constable did not, except that he had seen
Colonel Carson slinking away from the grounds
in woeful plight. It was said that the colonel had
lost a large sum of money on the game.</p>

<p>With the orderly, they hastened to the riding
hall. Grouped in the rear, they found a small
crowd of cadets, in the midst of whom stood
Colonel Gunn and Randall, while a motionless
figure could be made out on the ground.</p>

<p>“Ha&mdash;Merriwell!” cried the principal, who had
recovered his momentarily lost ponderous manner.
“Here is the&mdash;ah&mdash;individual of whom we
were in search. He appears to have been in this
posture for some little time.”</p>

<p>Merry and the constable pushed through, to
see Bully Carson lying on the ground. He was
motionless, and was breathing stertorously. Although
his one good eye did not open, he seemed
dimly conscious that others were around him.</p>

<p>“Go ’way!” he muttered thickly. “Go ’way!”</p>

<p>“He don’t look drunk, exactly,” observed the
constable, “and he ain’t hurt.”</p>

<p>“No, he does not&mdash;ah&mdash;appear to be under the<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
influence of liquor. Perhaps he is merely&mdash;ah&mdash;reposing
in the arms of Morpheus.”</p>

<p>“No, Murphy was lookin’ for him to-day,” rejoined
the constable, referring to his assistant.
Colonel Gunn’s lips twitched.</p>

<p>“See if you can resuscitate him, Merriwell.
The sooner we could&mdash;ah&mdash;relieve Randall of the
unfortunate difficulties surrounding him, the
better.”</p>

<p>Merry knelt over Bully and raised his head,
shaking his shoulders in no very gentle fashion.
Bully grunted and opened his eyes in a dazed
manner. At the same instant a small, very much
flustered man pushed through the group.</p>

<p>“Hello, here’s Hostetter now,” announced the
constable. “Colonel Gunn, this is him.”</p>

<p>“I heard that Carson had been found,” exclaimed
Hostetter. “Nothing has happened to
him, I trust?”</p>

<p>Bully answered for himself. Sitting up suddenly
and pushing Merry away, he glanced
around with dull and yet frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” he muttered thickly. “Where’s
Hostetter?”</p>

<p>“Right here, old man,” cried the little laundryman
fervently. “Have you managed to locate
my pocketbook? You know you said this morning
that you might be able to get a clew.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’,” said Bully thickly. “I must<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
’a’ been asleep&mdash;it was that there glass o’ water,
I’ll bet a dollar!”</p>

<p>He tried to get to his feet, Chip assisting him,
but stumbled and fell back. As he did so, a long
black object fell from his pocket. Hostetter
pounced on it with a shrill yell.</p>

<p>“My wallet! How&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>As he examined it feverishly, Bully once more
came to life. He clapped a hand to his pocket,
then staggered up.</p>

<p>“Where’s my wallet!” he growled, clutching
for support.</p>

<p>“Your wallet!” cried Merry. “You mean Hostetter’s
wallet. Where’d you get it, eh? Are you
the one that stole it?”</p>

<p>Bully seemed to shrink suddenly into himself,
muttering and mumbling.</p>

<p>“Who says I stole it?” he grunted defiantly,
only half conscious yet. He gave a lurch and
caught at Merriwell for support. “Hostetter&mdash;durned
little fool&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” exclaimed Merriwell
sharply. Bully tried to rouse himself. “Here,
one of you fellows get a bucket of water, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Lemme go,” grunted Bully, trying to reel
away. “I got to place bet&mdash;thousand-dollar bet&mdash;little
fool Hostetter handed me his money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie!” snapped Hostetter suddenly. “I
believe you stole that money, Carson!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[307]</span></p>

<p>“I believe so, too,” said Merry dryly. “Constable,
you’d better get ready to take charge of
him when&mdash;ah, here’s the water now!”</p>

<p>One of the grinning cadets arrived with a pail
of water. Bully had already relapsed into slumber,
and Merry took the water and soused it over
his head.</p>

<p>A second later Bully was on his feet, shaking
his head and bellowing in fury.</p>

<p>“That’s enough out o’ you,” said the constable,
tapping him on the shoulder. “I guess you can
come along to the lockup, my man.”</p>

<p>Bully let out a yell of fear.</p>

<p>“What fur!” he wailed, as the constable
gripped him firmly. “I ain’t done nothin’! Take
your hands off’n me!”</p>

<p>“For the theft of Mr. Hostetter’s pocketbook,”
said Colonel Gunn, in his most military voice,
facing the astounded Bully. “You, sir, have been&mdash;ah&mdash;apprehended
with the stolen property on
your person. While still in a condition of semi-coma,
you made certain admissions which most
undoubtedly will&mdash;ah&mdash;be put to service in the
cause of justice.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give it back!” wailed Bully. “It was only
a joke&mdash;I didn’t mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Constable, remove the&mdash;ah&mdash;prisoner!”</p>

<p>The constable did so. The last that was seen
of Bully Carson, he was trailing along and tearfully<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
expostulating. Colonel Gunn turned to
Randall.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, Mr. Randall, on being thus&mdash;ah&mdash;exonerated
of all the faint suspicion which&mdash;ah&mdash;clung
to your footsteps, in a manner of
speaking. You will kindly report at my office
Monday morning to state why you should not be
punished for leaving your room and the school
grounds without permission last evening. Gentlemen,
I bid you good day! Oh&mdash;one moment,
Merriwell! That&mdash;ah&mdash;that was the most remarkable,
I think I may say the most spectacular,
game of baseball I ever witnessed. Sir, I heartily
congratulate you on your playing!”</p>

<p>And with a stiff bow, Colonel Gunn beckoned
his orderly and strode away.</p>

<p>Merry looked after him, then turned to Randall
with a smile, his hand out.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, old man!” he said. “Come along
over to the gym while I get into my clothes, will
you? I’ve got something I want to say.”</p>

<p>Randall gave him a half-frightened look, but
merely nodded assent. The two walked to the
gym together, and more than one cadet looked
after them significantly, with the remark that
Randall had been fetched around, after all.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose was the trouble with
Bully?” queried Chip, as they entered the gymnasium
building. “It looked to me rather as if
he had been drugged, Bob!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[309]</span></p>

<p>Randall flushed.</p>

<p>“Maybe he had,” he said bitterly. “I knew
that he was pretty bad, but I never suspected that
he could stoop to being a thief.”</p>

<p>“I guess there are a whole lot of things about
your cousin that you never suspected,” returned
Merry dryly.</p>

<p>They found the dressing room almost deserted,
the members of the team having disappeared long
since. Merry had his shower and rubdown, and
returned to his locker where Randall was waiting.</p>

<p>“That was a great finish to-day, Chip,” said
the Southerner, rather awkwardly. “And your
pitching showed me a whole lot I had never even
guessed. If I had been in your place, they’d have
pounded me off the mound in two innings, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Chip. “Luck broke with us,
that was all. By the way, their pitcher was
Southpaw Diggs, Bob. Some credit in beating
him, eh? I was almost gone in the seventh, for
a fact.”</p>

<p>“Diggs!” Bob gasped. “I guess you had
mighty little luck in that game, Chip, and a whole
lot of good playing! I heard a fellow near us
saying that he thought the first baseman was a
semipro player from Buffalo.”</p>

<p>“Likely enough,” said Chip thoughtfully. “I
wouldn’t be surprised if Colonel Carson had got
professionals all the way through, because he expected
to clear up a big wad. It must have cost<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
him a lot, even besides what he lost! Well, that
only goes to show that a fellow gets exactly what
he gives, Bob. Your attitude toward the world
will be bound to be reflected back at you from
the world.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s about right,” and Randall’s
handsome face clouded.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Chip suddenly, “I may
leave Fardale almost any time now, old man. I
had a notion of having a team meeting to-night
or Monday, and putting it up to them about electing
you captain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, Chip,” broke in Randall,
his eyes fixing those of Merry in a peculiar fashion.
“Did you and Carson drink those glasses of
water I had poured out?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” Merry’s thoughts went back swiftly
to the scene in Bob’s room. “Why, yes!”</p>

<p>“Then that’s what’s the matter with Bully,”
and Randall faced Merry, white-faced but firm.
“I had doped one glass of water, hoping to put
you out of the game for the afternoon. He got
it by mistake. I pretended to be placated by your
words this morning, Chip, and&mdash;well, I began to
see differently later, that’s all. Now go ahead
and do anything you want to&mdash;I’m glad that I’ve
made a clean breast of it.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Chip quietly. “As I was saying,
I hope you’ll be elected the captain, to succeed
me when I leave, Bob.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p>“You what!” gasped Randall, staring. “You’re
joking with me!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Merry. “I suppose Bully
persuaded you to dope me?”</p>

<p>“Well, he had a little to do with it,” admitted
Randall, too proud to cast the blame where it
rightly lay. “I can only apologize, Chip, and
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, old man, forget all about it!” exclaimed
Merry, catching the other about the shoulders
and turning toward the door. “There was nobody
damaged in any way except Bully.”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, and laughed.</p>

<p>“Look here, Bob! He tried to make you the
goat to put me out of the way, see? He probably
figured that Southpaw Diggs could handle
either one of us, but without the double shoot
Fardale would get pounded. Then he got hold of
that stuff by accident and it laid him out. Except
for that, you might still be under suspicion of
stealing Hostetter’s money! It was only his
being doped that really saved you!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Merry!” and Randall’s eyes
flashed. “I believe he’d have let me suffer for
it, too, the cowardly cur! Look here, old man,
will you take my hand and accept my apologies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[312]</span></p>

<p>“Great Scott, how often do you want me to
tell you so?” returned Chip, with mock despair.
He wrung the Southerner’s hand heartily.</p>

<p>“Now let’s get out into the open air. I’m about
ready for something to eat, if you want to know
it!”</p>

<p>They left the building behind and started
across the campus for the barracks. It still being
some time before assembly and mess. As they
neared the barracks, they were approached by a
tall figure neatly clad in a dark-blue suit. He
gave them a keen glance, then stopped them
quietly.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Merriwell, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Merry flung him a look, and started.</p>

<p>“Hello! It’s Green&mdash;or I should say Diggs!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Southpaw Diggs,” and the other smiled
as he held out his hand. “I just want to congratulate
you on winning a remarkably fine
game, Merriwell&mdash;one of the best I ever saw, in
fact. If you’d only consider big-league work
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” said Merry. “I’ve had a sample
of professional ethics this afternoon, when you
and your friends masqueraded as amateurs.
That’s one reason, though I don’t blame you as I
do Colonel Carson.”</p>

<p>“What can a fellow do when he needs the
money?” and Diggs shrugged his shoulders good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[313]</span></p>

<p>“He can get busy and make it cleanly,” retorted
Chip, watching the other. With a quick
impulse he added: “And if he’d cut out the booze,
Diggs.”</p>

<p>Diggs flushed and his eyes kindled. Then he
smiled again and nodded.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Merriwell, and I know you
mean me. Well, I’m only twenty-four, and if I
brace up I’d have a few years ahead of me of
baseball. I’ve been thinking it over, and, to tell
you the truth, I’ve not had a drink for a good
while. I was testing my nerves out on you fellows
to-day, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“I hope they suited you?” said Merry.</p>

<p>“Oh, mine were all right until you pulled that
last bag of tricks. Well, so long, son, and good
luck go with you!”</p>

<p>“And the same to you, Diggs,” said Merry
earnestly.</p>

<p>He walked on with Randall, neither speaking.
At the door of the barracks they came upon
Clancy and Billy Mac, who immediately met them
with wide grins.</p>

<p>“Buried the hatchet, you two?” queried Clan.</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Chip. “By the way, I’d like
to ask a special favor of you fellows, sight unseen.
Will you grant it?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” returned Clancy.</p>

<p>“Anything you want, old man,” said Billy
Mac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[314]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m thinking of proposing Bob for captain
in my place, and I want you two fellows to
second it. How does it strike you?”</p>

<p>Clancy looked at Randall, and grinned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he said. “Only I’ll give you a run for
your money, Bob, because I’m going after that
job myself. I’ll second you, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Billy. “But I guess I can
see right now where Carrot-top Clancy gets
snowed under about two miles! Shake, Cap
Randall!”</p>

<p>Merry smiled.</p>

<div class="boxtop">

<p class="p-1">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be&mdash;behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

<p class="ir0 largefont" style="margin-top:-0.75em">Clean Adventure Stories for Boys</p>

<p class="center largefont">The Most Complete List Published</p>

<p>The following list does not contain all the books that Horatio Alger
wrote, but it contains most of them, and certainly the best.</p>

<p>Horatio Alger is to boys what Charles Dickens is to grown-ups. His
work is just as popular to-day as it was years ago. The books have
a quality, the value of which is beyond computation.</p>

<p>There are legions of boys of foreign parents who are being helped
along the road to true Americanism by reading these books which are
so peculiarly American in tone that the reader cannot fail to absorb
some of the spirit of fair play and clean living which is so characteristically
American.</p>

<p>In this list will be included certain books by Edward Stratemeyer,
Oliver Optic, and other authors who wrote the Alger type of stories,
which are equal in interest and wholesomeness with those written by
the famous author after whom this great line of books for boys is
named.</p>
